<span class="smallcaps">To my Readers:</span><br />
</p>

<p class="new_para">Six months since, I was in a deplorable state of
ignorance as to the most felicitous style of Preface;
at this lapse of time, I find myself not a whit the
wiser. You will permit me, therefore, in pressing
again your friendly hands, simply to say, that I hope
my second offering of &ldquo;Fern Leaves&rdquo; will be more
worthy of your acceptance, than the first.</p>

<h2 title="" class="title">Fern Leaves&mdash;Second Series.</h2>

<h2>SHADOWS AND SUNBEAMS.</h2>
<h3>CHAPTER I.</h3>

<p class="new_para">I can see it now: the little brown house, with its sloping
roof, its clumsy old chimneys, and its vine-clad porch; where
the brown bee hummed his drowsy song, and my silver-haired
old father sat dozing the sultry summer noons away, with
shaggy Bruno at his feet. The bright earth had no blight
or mildew then for me. The song of the little birds, resting
beneath the eaves, filled my heart with a quiet joy. It was
sweet, when toil was over, to sit in the low door-way, and
watch the golden sun go down, and see the many-tinted clouds
fade softly away (like a dying saint) into the light of heaven,
and evening&#8217;s glittering star glow, like a seraph&#8217;s eye, above
them. &#8217;Twas sweet, when Autumn touched the hill-side foliage
with rainbow dyes, to see the gorgeous leaves come circling
down on the soft Indian-summer breeze. &#8217;Twas sweet, when
the tripping, silver stream lay still and cold in Winter&#8217;s icy
clasp, and the flowers fainted beneath his chilly breath, and
the leafless trees stretched out their imploring arms, and shook
off, impatiently, their snowy burthen, and the heavy wagon-<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span>wheels
went creaking past, and the ruddy farmer struck his
brawny arms across his ample chest, for warmth, and goaded
the lazy, round-eyed oxen up the icy hill. Even then, it was
sunshine still, in the little brown house: in the ample chimney
glowed and crackled the blazing faggots; rows of shining pans
glittered upon the shelves; the fragrant loaf steamed in the little
oven; the friendly tea-kettle, smoking, sang in the chimney
corner, and by its side still sat the dear old father, with the
faithful newspaper, that weekly brought us news from the busy
world, from which our giant forest-trees had shut us out.</p>

<p class="new_para">Ah! those were happy days: few wants and no cares:
the patriarch&#8217;s head was white with grave blossoms, yet his
heart was fresh and green. Alas! that, under the lowliest door-way,
as through the loftiest portal, the Guest unbidden cometh.
The morning sun rose fair, but it shone upon silver locks that
stirred with no breath of life, upon loving lips forever mute,
upon a palsied, kindly hand that gave no returning pressure.
Soon, over the heart so warm and true, the snow lay white and
cold; the winter wind sang its mournful requiem, and from out
the little brown house, the orphan passed with tearful gaze and
lingering footstep.</p>
<h3>CHAPTER II.</h3>

<p class="new_para">Oh, the bitter, bitter bread of dependence! No welcome by
the hearth-stone: no welcome at the board: the mocking tone,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span>
the cutting taunt, the grudged morsel. Weary days, and sleepless,
memory-torturing nights.</p>

<p class="new_para">&ldquo;Well, Josiah&#8217;s dead and gone,&rdquo; said my uncle, taking down
his spectacles from the mantel, to survey me, as I sank on the
settle, in the chimney corner. &ldquo;Take off your bonnet, Hetty.
I suppose we must give you house-room. Josiah never had
the knack of saving anything&mdash;more&#8217;s the pity for <em>you</em>. That
farm of his was awfully mismanaged. I could have had twice
the produce he did off that land. Sheer nonsense, that shallow
ploughing of his, tiring the land all out; he should have used
the sub-soil plough. Then he had no idea of the proper
rotation of crops, or how to house his cattle in winter, or to
keep his tools where they wouldn&#8217;t rust and rot. That new
barn, too, was a useless extravagance. He might have roofed
the old one. It&#8217;s astonishing what a difference there is in brothers,
about getting beforehand in the world. Now I&#8217;ve a cool
thousand in the bank, all for taking care of little things. (There,
Jonathan! Jonathan! you&#8217;ve taken the meal out of the wrong
barrel: it was the damaged meal I told you to carry to Widow
Folger.)</p>

<p class="new_para">&ldquo;Well, as I was saying, Hetty, in the first place, your father
didn&#8217;t know how to manage; then he didn&#8217;t know how to say
No. He&#8217;d lend money to anybody who wanted it, and pay his
workmen just what they took it into their heads it was right to
ask. Now, there&#8217;s Jonathan, yonder; a day or two since, he
struck for higher wages. Well, I <em>let</em> him strike, and got an
Irishman in his place. This morning he came whining back,
saying that his wife was sick, and his youngest child lay dead<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span>
in the house, and that he was willing to work on at the old
wages. That&#8217;s the way to do, Hetty. If Jonathan chose to
saddle himself with a wife and babies, before he was able to
feed them, I don&#8217;t see the justice of my paying for it. But it&#8217;s
time for family prayers: that will be something new to you, I
suppose. I don&#8217;t want to judge <em>any</em> body: I hope your father
has gone to Heaven, but I&#8217;m afraid he didn&#8217;t let his light shine.
Don&#8217;t whimper, child; as the tree falls so it must lie. You
must see that you do <em>your</em> duty: make yourself useful here in
my house, and try to pay your way. Young people of your
age consume a great deal in the way of food and clothes.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="new_para">Oh, the monotony of those weary days! how memory lingered
over the sunny past: how thought shrank back affrighted
from the gloomy future: how untiringly and thanklessly I
strove to cancel the debt for daily bread, and how despairingly
I prayed for relief from such bitter thraldom.</p>
<h3>CHAPTER <span class="correction" title="Transcriber&apos;s Note: Period added.">III.</span></h3>

<p class="new_para">&ldquo;Make up the bed in the north room, Hetty,&rdquo; said my aunt;
&ldquo;it&#8217;s our turn to board the schoolmaster this week. You
needn&#8217;t put on the best sheets: these book-learning folks are
always wool-gathering. He never&#8217;ll know the difference. What
a hungry set these schoolmasters are, to be sure: it keeps a
body all the time cooking. A bushel of doughnuts is a mere<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span>
circumstance. When the last master was here, our winter
barrel of cider went off like snow in April. I hope Jonathan
learned enough at school to pay for it, but I have my doubts:
he trips in the multiplication table yet. Your uncle and I
think that this boarding schoolmasters is a poor business&mdash;a
losing bargain. He says I must put less on the table, but it is
no use to try that game with George Grey. He&#8217;s as independent
as Adam in Eden, before the serpent and his wife got in.
He&#8217;d just as lief call for anything he wanted as not, and somehow
or other, when he does, I always feel as if I had no choice
about bringing it. That eye of his always makes me think of
forked lightning; and yet he&#8217;s kindly spoken, too. He is as
much of a riddle to unravel, as one of Parson Jones&#8217; doctrinal
sermons. But, go make his bed, Hetty, and mind you stuff a
few rags in that broken pane of glass over it. I spoke to your
uncle about getting it mended, but he said warm weather would
be along in three months, and that&#8217;s very true, Hetty. Hist!
your uncle is calling you. He says he is going out in the barn
to thresh, and if Peter Tay comes up the road, and stops in
here again, for him to subscribe towards the minister&#8217;s new
cloak, you must say that he has gone to Jifftown, and will not
be home for a week at least. Now don&#8217;t forget, Hetty: people
seem to think one earns money now-a-days on purpose to
give away. A new cloak! humph! I wonder if the Apostle
Paul&#8217;s hearers ever gave him a new cloak? I wonder if John
the Baptist ever had a donation party? Don&#8217;t the minister
have his salary, two hundred dollars a year&mdash;part in produce,
part in money; paid regularly, when the times ain&#8217;t too hard?<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span>
Go make the school-master&#8217;s bed now, Hetty. One pillow will
do for him. Goodness knows he carries his head high enough
when he is awake. I shouldn&#8217;t wonder if he had been captain
or colonel, or something, some muster day.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="new_para">The schoolmaster! Should I be permitted to go to school?
or should I be kept drudging at home? Would this Mr. Grey
think me very ignorant? I began to feel as if his forked-lightning
eyes were already on me. My cheeks grew hot at the
idea of making a blunder in his awful presence. What a miserable
room my aunt had provided for him! If I could but
put up some nice white curtains at the window, or get him a
cushioned chair, or put in a bureau, or chest of drawers. It
looked so comfortless&mdash;so different from the welcome my dear
old father was wont to give to &ldquo;the stranger within the gates;&rdquo;
and now memory pictured him, as he sat in the old arm chair,
and I knelt again at the low foot-stool at his feet, and his hand
strayed caressingly over my temples, and I listened to old continental
stories, till the candle burned low in the socket, and
only the fire-light flickered dimly on the old portrait of General
Washington, and on my father&#8217;s time-worn face.</p>

<p class="new_para">My aunt&#8217;s shrill voice soon roused me from my reverie.
Dinner time had come, and with it Mr. Grey&mdash;a gentlemanly
young man, of about two and twenty, with a bright, keen, blue
eye, and a frank, decided, off-hand manner, that seemed to me
admirably in keeping with his erect, imposing figure and firm
step. Even my uncle reefed in a sail or two in his presence,
and my aunt involuntarily qualified her usual bluntness of manner.
I uttered a heartfelt thanksgiving when dinner was <span class="correction"
title="Transcriber&apos;s Note: Period added.">over.</span></p>

<p class="new_para"><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span></p>
<h3>CHAPTER IV.</h3>

<p class="new_para">&ldquo;Hetty,&rdquo; said my uncle, as the door closed upon Mr. Grey.
&ldquo;I suppose you must go to school, or the neighbors will say
we don&#8217;t treat you well. You ought to be very thankful for
such a home as this, Hetty; women are poor miserable creatures,
left without money. I wish it had pleased Providence
to have made you a boy. You might then have done Jonathan&#8217;s
work just as well as not, and saved me his wages and board.
There&#8217;s a piece of stone wall waiting to be laid, and the barn
wants shingling. Josiah now would be at the extravagance of
hiring a mason and a carpenter to do it.</p>

<p class="new_para">&ldquo;Crying? I wonder what&#8217;s the matter now? Well, it&#8217;s
beyond me to keep track of anything in the shape of a woman.
One moment they are up in the attic of ecstasy; the next, down
in the cellar of despondency, as the Almanac says; and it is
as true as if it had been written in the Apocrypha. I only said
that it is a thousand pities that you were not a boy; then you
could graft my trees for me, and hoe, and dig, and plant, and
plough, and all that sort of thing. This puttering round, washing
dishes a little, and mopping floors a little, and wringing out
a few clothes, don&#8217;t amount to much toward supporting yourself.
Let me see, you have had, since you came here&rdquo;&mdash;and
my uncle put on his spectacles, and pulled out a well-thumbed
pocket memorandum&mdash;&ldquo;You&#8217;ve had<span class="spaced"> two pairs</span> of shoes, at
<span class="spaced"> three shillings</span> a pair, and nine yards of calico, for a
dress, at<span class="spaced"> six cents</span> a yard. That &#8217;mounts up, Hetty, &#8217;mounts
up. You see it costs something to keep you. I earned <em>my</em><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span>
money, and if you ever expect to have any, you must earn
yours&rdquo;&mdash;and my uncle took out his snuff-box, helped himself
to a pinch, and, with the timely
aid of a stray sunbeam, achieved
a succession of very satisfactory sneezes.</p>

<p class="new_para">The following day, under the overwhelming consciousness of
my feminity and consequent good-for-nothingness, I made my
debut at Master Grey&#8217;s school.</p>

<p class="new_para">It was a huge barn of a room, ill lighted, ill warmed, and
worse ventilated, crowded with pupils of both sexes, from the
little, chubby A B C D-arian, to the gaunt Jonathan of thirty,
who had begun to feel the need of a little ciphering and geography,
in making out his accounts, or superscribing a business letter.
There were rows of awkward, mop-headed, freckled, red-fisted
boys; and rosy-cheeked, buxom lasses, bursting out of their
dresses, half-shy, half-saucy, who were much more conversant
with &ldquo;apple bees,&rdquo; and &ldquo;husking frolics,&rdquo; than with grammar
or philosophy. There was the parson&#8217;s son, and the squire&#8217;s
and the blacksmith&#8217;s son, besides a few who hadn&#8217;t the remotest
idea whose sons they were, having originally been indentured
to their farming masters, by the overseers of the
county alms-house.</p>

<p class="new_para">Amid these discordant elements, Master Grey moved as serenely
as the August moon of a cloudless night; now patting
some little curly head, cruelly perplexed by &ldquo;crooked S;&rdquo; now
demonstrating to some slow, older brain, a stumbling block in
Euclid; now closing the creaking door after an ill-mannered
urchin; now overlooking the pot-hooks and trammels of an unsophisticated
scribe, who clutched the pen as if it were a hoe-<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span>handle;
now feeding the great, draftless Behemoth of a stove
with green hickory knots, and vainly attempting to thaw out
his own congealed fingers.</p>

<p class="new_para">In a remote corner of the school-room sat Zeb Smith, the
village blacksmith&#8217;s son, who came into the world with his fists
doubled up, and had been pugilist-ing ever since. It was Zeb&#8217;s
proud boast that &ldquo;he had <span class="correction"
title="Transcriber&apos;s Note: Originally &ldquo;whippped&rdquo;">whipped</span> every schoolmaster who
had ever appeared in Frog-town,&rdquo; and in his peaceful retreat
from under his bent brows, he was now mentally taking the
measure of Master Grey, ending his little reverie with a loud,
protracted whistle.</p>

<p class="new_para">Master Grey turned quickly round, and facing his overgrown
pupil of thirty, said in a voice clear as the click of a pistol,
&ldquo;You will be pleased not to repeat that annoyance, Mr. Smith.&rdquo;
Zeb bent his gooseberry eyes full upon the master, and gave
him a blast of &ldquo;Yankee Doodle.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="new_para">All eyes were bent on Master Grey. The <span class="correction"
title="Transcriber&apos;s Note: Originally &ldquo;guantlet&rdquo;">gauntlet</span> of defiance
was thrown in his very teeth. Zeb had a frame like an
ox, and a fist like a sledge-hammer, and he knew it. Master
Grey was slight, but panther-y; to their unscientific eyes, he
was already victimized.</p>

<p class="new_para">Not a bit of it! See! Master Grey&#8217;s delicate white fingers
are on Zeb&#8217;s check shirt-collar; there is a momentary struggle:
lips grow white; teeth are set; limbs twist, and writhe, and
mingle, and now Zeb lies on the floor with Master Grey&#8217;s handsome
foot on his brawny chest. Ah, Master Grey! science is
sometimes a match for bone and muscle. Your boxing master,
Monsieur Punchmellow, would have been proud of his pupil.</p>

<p class="new_para"><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span></p>

<p class="new_para">Peace restored, Master Grey shakes back from his broad
forehead his curly locks, and summons the first class in geography.
A row of country girls, round as little barrels and red
as peonies, stand before him, their respect and admiration for
&ldquo;the master&rdquo; having been increased ten per cent. by his victory
over Zeb. Feminity pardons any thing in a man sooner
than lack of courage. The recitation goes off very well, with
the exception of Miss Betsey Jones, who persists in not reciting
at all. Master Grey looks at her: he has conquered a <em>man</em>,
but that&#8217;s no reason why he should suppose he can conquer a
<em>woman</em>. He sees that written in very legible characters in
Miss Bessie&#8217;s saucy black eye. Miss Bessy is sent to her seat,
and warned to stay after school, till her lesson is learned and
recited perfectly. With admirable nonchalance, she takes her
own time to obey, and commences drawing little caricatures of
the master, which she places in her shoe, and passes round under
the desk, to her more demure petticoat neighbors.</p>

<p class="new_para">School is dismissed: the last little straggler is kicking up his
heels in the snow drifts, and Master Grey and Miss Bessie are
left alone. Master Grey inquires if the lesson is learned, and
is told again by Miss Bessie, with a toss of her ringlets, that
she has no intention of learning it. Master Grey again reminds
her that the lesson must be recited before she can go
home. Bessie looks mischievously at the setting sun, and plays
with the master&#8217;s commands and her apron strings. An hour
passes, and Bessie has not opened the book. Master Grey consults
his watch, and reminds her &ldquo;that it is growing dark.&rdquo;
Bessie smiles till the dimples play hide and seek on her cheek,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span>
but she says nothing. Another hour: Master Grey bites his
lip, and, replacing his watch in his pocket, says, &ldquo;I see your
intention, Miss Betsey. It is quite impossible, as you know,
for us to remain here after dark. To-morrow morning, if your
lesson is not learned, I shall punish you in the presence of the
whole school. You can go.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="new_para">&ldquo;Thank you, sir,&rdquo; says Bessie, with mock humility, as she
crushed her straw hat down over her bright ringlets.</p>

<p class="new_para">&ldquo;Mischief take these women,&rdquo; Master Grey was heard to
utter, as he went through the snow by starlight to a cold supper.
&ldquo;Shall I conquer Zeb, to strike my colors to a girl of
sixteen?&rdquo;</p>

<p class="new_para">There was plenty to talk about over the brown bread and
milk, at the farmers&#8217; tea-tables that night; the youngsters all
made up their minds that if there was &ldquo;a time to play,&rdquo; it was
not in Master Grey&#8217;s school-room, and the old farmers said they
were glad the District had a schoolmaster at last that was good
for something, and that they should think better of city chaps
in future for his sake. Even Zeb himself acknowledged, over
his father&#8217;s forge, as he mended his broken suspenders, that
Master Grey was a &ldquo;trump.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="new_para">The nine o&#8217;clock bell summoned again the Frog-town pupils
to the District School. Master Grey in vain looked in Bessie&#8217;s
face for any sign of submission. She had evidently made up
her mind to brave him. After the usual preliminary exercises,
she was called up to recite. Fixing her saucy black eyes upon
him, she said, &ldquo;I told you I would <em>not</em> learn that lesson, and
I have not learned it.&rdquo; &ldquo;And I told <em>you</em>,&rdquo; said Master Grey, (a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span>
slight flush passing over his forehead) <span class="correction"
title="Transcriber&apos;s Note: Opening double quotation mark added.">&ldquo;that</span> I should punish you
if you did not learn it? Did I not?&rdquo; Bessie&#8217;s red lip quivered,
but she deigned him no reply.</p>

<p class="new_para">&ldquo;You will hold out your hand, Betsey,&rdquo; said Mr. Grey, taking
up a large ferule that lay beside him. The color left
Bessie&#8217;s cheek, but the little hand was extended with martyr-like
determination, and amid a silence that might be felt, the ferule
came down upon it, with justice as unflinching as if it were not
owned by a woman. Betsey was not proof against this humiliation;
she burst into tears, and the answering tear in Master
Grey&#8217;s eye showed how difficult and repugnant had been the
task.</p>

<p class="new_para">From that day, Master Grey was &ldquo;monarch of all he surveyed,&rdquo;
and, truth compels me to own, by none better loved
or more implicitly obeyed, than by Miss Bessie.</p>

<p class="new_para">Master Grey&#8217;s &ldquo;boarding week&rdquo; at my uncle&#8217;s had now expired.
What a change had it effected in me! Life was no
longer aimless: the old, glad sparkle had come back to my
heavy eye; I no longer dreaded the solitude of my own thoughts.
The dull rain dropping on my chamber roof had its music for
my ears; the stars wore a new and a glittering brightness,
and Winter, with his snowy mantle, frosty breath, and
icicle diadem, seemed lovelier to me than violet-slippered
Spring, with roses in her hair. I still saw Master Grey each
day at school. How patiently he bore with my multiplied
deficiencies, and with what a delicate and womanly appreciation
of my extreme sensitiveness, he soothed my wounded pride.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span>
No pale-eyed flower fainting beneath the garish noonday heat
ever so thirsted for the cool dews of twilight, as did my desolate
heart for his soothing tones and kindly words.</p>
<h3>CHAPTER V.</h3>

<p class="new_para">&ldquo;Betsey,&rdquo; said my uncle, &ldquo;we shall want you at home now.
It will be impossible for me to get along without you, unless I
hire a hand, and times are too hard for that: so you must leave
school. You&#8217;ve a good home here, for which you ought to be
thankful, as I&#8217;ve told you before; but you must work, girl,
work! Some how or other the money goes;&rdquo; (and he pulled
out the old pocket-bock;) &ldquo;here&#8217;s my grocer&#8217;s bill&mdash;two shillings
for tea, and three shillings for sugar; can&#8217;t you do with
out sugar, Hetty? And here&#8217;s a dollar charged for a pair of
India rubbers. A dollar is a great deal of money, Hetty; more
than you could earn in a month. And here&#8217;s a shilling for a
comb; now that&#8217;s useless, you might cut your hair off. It
won&#8217;t do&mdash;won&#8217;t do. I had no idea of the additional expense
when I took you in. Josiah ought to have left you something
no man has a right to leave his children for other people to support;
&#8217;tisn&#8217;t Christian. I&#8217;ve been a professor these twenty
years, and I ought to know. I don&#8217;t know as you have any
legal claim on me because you are my niece. Josiah was
thriftless and extravagant. I suppose &#8217;tis in your blood, too,
for I can&#8217;t find out that you have begun to pay your way by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span>
any chores you have done here. If you must live on us, (and
I can&#8217;t say that I see the necessity,) I repeat, I wish you had
been born a boy.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="new_para">&ldquo;But as I am not a boy, Uncle, and as I do not wish to be a
burthen to you, will you tell me how to support myself?&rdquo;</p>

<p class="new_para">&ldquo;Don&#8217;t ask me. I&#8217;m sure I don&#8217;t know. That is your
business. I have my hands full to attend to my own affairs.
I am deacon of the church, beside being trustee of the Sandwich
Island Fund. I don&#8217;t get a copper for the office of deacon;
nobody pays <em>me</em> for handing round the contribution box; not a
cent of the money that passes through my hands goes into my
till; not a <em>mill</em> do I have by way of perquisite, for doling it
out to bed-ridden Widow Hall, or asthmatic Mr. Price. Not
a penny the richer was I, for that twenty dollars I collected in
the contribution box at last communion: no, I am a poor man,
comparatively speaking. I may die yet in the almshouse; who
knows? You must work, girl, work; can&#8217;t have any drones
in my hive.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="new_para">A shadow just then passed the window. I should know
that retreating footstep! Could it be that Master Grey had
come to the door with the intention of calling, and overheard
my uncle? At least, then, I was spared the humiliation of exposing
his parsimony.</p>

<p class="new_para"><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span></p>
<h3>CHAPTER VI.</h3>

<p class="new_para">It was the night for the weekly vestry lecture. I was left
quite alone in the old kitchen. My uncle had extinguished the
lamp in leaving, saying that it was &ldquo;a waste to burn out oil for
me.&rdquo; The fire, also, had been carefully taken apart, and the
brands laid at an incombustible distance from each other. The
old clock kept up a sepulchral, death-watch tick, and I could
hear the falling snow drifting gloomily against the windows.</p>

<p class="new_para">I drew the old, wooden settle closer between the tall andirons,
and sat sorrowfully gazing into the dying embers. What
was to become of me? for it seemed impossible to bear longer
the intolerable galling of my yoke. Even the charity of
strangers seemed to me preferable to the grudging, insulting
tolerance of my kindred. But, with my sixteen years&#8217; experience
of quiet valley-life, where should I turn my untried footsteps?
To Him who guideth the little bird through the pathless
air, would I look.</p>

<p class="new_para">Weeping, I prayed.</p>

<p class="new_para">&ldquo;My poor child,&rdquo; said a voice at my side; and Master Grey
removed my hands gently from my tear-stained face, and held
them in his own. &ldquo;My poor Hetty, life looks very dark to
you, does it not? I know all you suffer. Don&#8217;t pain yourself
to tell me about it; I overheard your uncle&#8217;s crushing
words. I know there are none to love you&mdash;none to care for
you&mdash;none on whom you can lean. It is a bitter feeling, my
poor child. I, too, have passed through it. You would go<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span>
from hence, but where? Life is full of snares, and you are too
young, and too inexperienced to brave them.</p>

<p class="new_para">&ldquo;Hetty,&rdquo; and Master Grey drew me gently toward him,&mdash;&ldquo;Hetty,
could you be happy with me?&rdquo;</p>

<p class="new_para">Is the ship-wrecked mariner happy, who opens his despairing
eyes at length in the long looked for, long prayed for,
home?</p>

<p class="new_para">Is the little bird happy, who folds her weary wings safe from
the pursuer&#8217;s talons, in her own fleece-lined nest?</p>

<p class="new_para">Is the little child happy, who wakes, sobbing, in the gloomy
night, from troubled dreams, to find his golden head still safely
pillowed on the dear, maternal bosom?</p>
<h3>CHAPTER VII.</h3>

<p class="new_para">It was very odd and strange to me, my new home in the
great, busy city; with its huge rows of stores and houses, its
myriad restless feet, and anxious, care-worn faces; its glittering
wealth, its squalid poverty; the slow moving hearse, and the
laughing harlequin crowd; its noisy Sabbaths, and its gorgeous
churches, with its jeweled worshippers, and its sleepy
priests; its little children, worldly-wise and old, and its never-ceasing,
busy hum, late into the day&#8217;s pale light. I had no acquaintances:
I needed none; for I moved about my pretty
little home as in a glad dream. My husband was still &ldquo;Mas<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span>ter
Grey,&rdquo; but over a private school of his own, bounded by no
&ldquo;District,&rdquo; subject to the despotic dictation of no &ldquo;Committee.&rdquo;
In his necessary absence, I busied myself in arranging
and re-arranging his books, papers and wardrobe, thinking the
while such <em>glad</em> thoughts! And when the little mantel clock
chimed the hour of return, my cheek flushed, my heart beat
quick, and my eyes grew moist with happy tears, at the sound
of the dear, loved footstep.</p>

<p class="new_para">How very nice it seemed to sit at the head of that cheerful
little table&mdash;to make, with my own hands, the fragrant cup of
tea&mdash;to grow merry with my husband, over crest-fallen Zeb,
and poor, stubborn little Bessie, and my uncle&#8217;s time-worn bug-bear
of a memorandum book!</p>

<p class="new_para">And how proud I was of him, as he sat there correcting some
school-boy&#8217;s Greek exercise, while I leaned over his shoulder,
looking attentively at his fine face, and at those unintelligible
hieroglyphics, and blushing that he was so much wiser than his
little Hetty.</p>

<p class="new_para">This thought sometimes troubled me. I asked myself, will
my husband never weary of me? I even grew jealous of his
favorite authors, of whom he was so fond. Then I pondered
the feasibility of pursuing a course of reading unknown to him,
and astonishing him some day with my profound erudition. In
pursuance of my plan, I would sit demurely down to some
great, wise book; but I saw only my husband&#8217;s face looking
out at me from every page, and my self-inflicted task was sure
to end in some blissful dreamy reverie, with which Cupid had
much more to do than Minerva.</p>

<p class="new_para"><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span></p>
<h3>CHAPTER VIII.</h3>

<p class="new_para">&ldquo;A proposition, Hetty!&rdquo; said my husband, throwing aside
his coat and hat, and tossing a letter in my lap. &ldquo;It is from
a widow lady, who desires that I should take charge of her
little boy, and give him a home in my family, while she goes
to the continent, to secure some property lately left her by a
foreign relative. It will be advantageous to us, in a pecuniary
way, to have him board with us, unless it should increase your
cares too much. But, as you are so fond of children, it may,
perhaps, after all, prove a pleasant care to you. She is evidently
a superior woman. Every line in her letter shows it.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="new_para">My husband immediately answered in the affirmative, and
the child arrived a week after. He was a fine, intelligent, gentlemanly
boy of eight years, with large hazel eyes, and transparently
beautiful temples: disinclined to the usual sports of
childhood, sensitive, shy, and thoughtful beyond his years&mdash;a
human dew-drop, which we look to see exhale. He brought
with him a letter from his mother, which powerfully affected
my husband. During its perusal he drew his hand repeatedly
across his eyes, and sat a long while after he had finished reading
it, with his eyes closed, in a deep reverie. By-and-by he
said, handing me the letter, &ldquo;there is genius there, Hetty. I
never read anything so touchingly beautiful. Mrs. West must
be a very talented and superior woman.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="new_para">I glanced over the letter. It fully justified my husband&#8217;s encomiums.
It was a most touching appeal to him to watch with
paternal care over her only child; but while she spoke with a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</a></span>
mother&#8217;s tenderness of his endearing qualities, she wished him
taught implicitly, that first of all duties for the young, <em>obedience</em>.
Then followed allusions to dark days of sorrow, during which
the love of that cherished child, was the only star in her sky.</p>

<p class="new_para">I folded the letter and sat very still, after my husband left,
in my little rocking-chair, thinking. Such a gifted woman as
that my husband should have married. One who could have
sympathised with him and shared his intellectual pursuits; who
would have been something besides a toy to amuse an idle
hour, or to minister to his physical necessities. Perhaps it was
of this that my husband was thinking, as he sat there with his
eyes closed over the open letter. Perhaps he had wed me
only from a generous impulse of pity, and that letter had suddenly
revealed to him the happiness of which he was capable
with a kindred spirit. I was very miserable. I wished the
letter had never reached us, or that I had declined the care of
the child. Other letters, of course, would come, and the boy
would keep alive the interest in the intervals. I wept long and
bitterly. At length I was aroused by the entrance of little
Charley. A bright flush mounted to his forehead, when he
saw my swollen eyes. He hesitated a moment, then gliding
up to my side he said, sweetly, &ldquo;Are you sick? Shall I bathe
your head? I used to bathe mamma&#8217;s head when it pained
her.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="new_para">I stood abashed and rebuked in the child&#8217;s angel presence,
and taking the boy, <em>her</em> boy, in my arms, I kissed him as
tenderly as if I had been his mother; while in his own
sweet way he told me with childish confidence of his own<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span>
dead papa; how much he loved mamma; how many, many
beautiful things he used to bring her, saying that they were not
half good, or half handsome enough for her; how distressed
he used to be if she were ill; how carefully he closed the shutters,
and tip-toed about the house, with his finger on his lip,
telling the servants to close the doors gently; and how he promised
him little toys, if he would not disturb mamma&#8217;s slumbers;
and then, how like diamonds his eyes shone, when she
got well; and what beautiful flowers he brought her for her
vases; and what a nice, soft-cushioned carriage he brought for
her to take the air; and how tenderly he wrapped the shawls
about her, and how many charges he gave the coachman, to
drive slowly and carefully. And then, how dear papa, at last,
grew sick himself; and how mamma watched day and night
beside his bed, forgetting to sleep, or eat, or drink; and how
nobody dared to tell her that the doctor said he must die; and
how papa grew fainter and weaker, and how he said, &ldquo;Kiss me,
Mary, and lay your cheek to mine; I can&#8217;t see you.&rdquo; And
then, how mamma fainted and was carried out, and for many,
many long days didn&#8217;t know even her own little Charley;&mdash;and
how dreadful it was when she first waked, and tried to remember
what had happened; and how nobody could comfort
her but Charley; and how he used often to wake up
in the night, and find her with a lamp looking at him, because
when he was asleep he looked so much like dear, dead
papa; and how bitterly she would sob when she was sick, because
papa was not there to pity her, and bathe her aching
head; and how he (Charley) meant, when he grew up to be a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</a></span>
man, to get a nice house for her, and put everything she wanted
in it, and make her just as happy as he could.</p>

<p class="new_para">Well has the Saviour said, &ldquo;Of such is the kingdom of
Heaven.&rdquo; That night I bent over little Charley&#8217;s bed, blessing
the little sleeper for his angel teachings, with a heart as calm
and peaceful as the mirrored lake, reflecting only the smile of
Heaven.</p>

<p class="new_para">Time passed on. Life became earnest; for a little heart pulsated
beneath my own, and a strange, sweet, nameless thrill
sent to my chastened lips a trembling prayer. Tiny caps and
robes, with many a hope and fear interwoven in their delicate
threads, lay awaiting the infant&#8217;s advent. I, myself should
know the height, and breadth, and depth of a mother&#8217;s undying
love. What could come between me and <em>this</em> new found
treasure?</p>

<p class="new_para">Meantime letters continued to come from Charley&#8217;s mother
to her boy, and my husband. It was impossible for me to
blind myself to his growing interest in them. On the days
they were expected, (for she wrote at regular intervals,) he
would be absent and abstracted, or if any delay occurred, almost
irritable. When they were received, his eye kindled, his
step became elastic, and his whole face grew radiant with happiness.</p>

<p class="new_para">As the time drew near for the birth of my infant, I grew timid
with sad forebodings. I was sitting, one evening at twilight,
watching the setting sun, and thinking of the quiet grave it was
gilding, where my silver-haired father slept, in the old church
yard, when my husband entered. An expression of pain flitted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span>
over his features, as he looked at me, and taking my hand, he
said, gently, <em>almost tenderly</em>, &ldquo;You are less well than usual,
Hetty; you must not sit here, moping, by yourself.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="new_para">I laid my head upon his shoulder with a happiness I had not
known for many months. &ldquo;Listen to me, dear Grey,&rdquo; said I;
&ldquo;I have a confidence to repose in you that will ease my heart.</p>

<p class="new_para">&ldquo;It was pity, only, that drew your heart to mine; you do not
love me. I have known it a long while since. At first, the
discovery gave me a pang keener than death; but I have had
a long and bitter struggle with myself, and have conquered.
It is not your fault that you cannot love me. To the many
voices of your heart, which cry, &lsquo;Give, give,&rsquo; my response is
weak and unsatisfying. Your wife should be gifted. She
should sympathise with you in your intellectual pursuits. She
should stimulate your pride, as well as your love. Such an
one is Charley&#8217;s mother. Your <em>heart</em> has already wed her, and
as God is my witness, I have ceased to blame you. We cannot
help our affections. I cannot help loving you, though I
know her mysterious power over your heart. I have seen your
struggles, your generous self-reproaches, in some sudden outburst
of kindness toward me, after the indulgence of some
bright dream, in which I had no share. Dear Grey, she is
worthy of your love. She has a heart, noble, good and true;
a heart purified by suffering. I see it in every line she writes.
Should I not survive the birth of my infant, I could give your
happiness into her keeping without a misgiving, though I have
never looked upon her face.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="new_para"><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</a></span></p>

<p class="new_para">Little Hetty&#8217;s noble heart has long since ceased to throb with
joy or pain. To her husband&#8217;s breast is folded the babe, for
whose little life her own was yielded up. Threads of silver
prematurely mingle amid his ebon locks; for memory writes
only on bereaved hearts the virtues of the dead, while, with torturing
minuteness, she pictures our own short-comings, for which,
alas! we can offer no atonement but our tears.</p>

<h2>AUNT HEPSY.</h2>
<p class="new_para">It was a comical little old shop, &ldquo;Aunt Hepsy&#8217;s,&rdquo; with its Lilliputian
counter, shelves and stove, and its pigmy assortment
of old-fashioned ginghams, twilled cambrics, red flannels, factory
cotton and homespun calicoes; its miniature window, with
its stock of horn-combs and candy, tin horses and peppermint
drops, skeins of yarn and Godfrey&#8217;s Cordial, gaudy picture
books, and six-penny handkerchiefs, from whose center Lafayette
and George Washington smiled approbatively upon the
big A&#8217;s and little A&#8217;s printed round the border.</p>

<p class="new_para">&ldquo;Aunt Hepsy;&rdquo; so every brimless-hatted urchin in the neighborhood
called her, though it would have puzzled them worse
than the multiplication table, had you asked them why they
did so. Year in and year out, her ruddy English face glowed
behind the little shop window. Sometimes she would be knitting
a pair of baby&#8217;s socks, sometimes inventing most astonishing
looking bags out of rainbow fragments of silk or ribbon.
Sometimes netting watch-guards, or raveling the yarn from some
old black stocking, to ornament the &ldquo;place where the wool
ought to grow,&rdquo; on the head of some Topsy doll she was making.
Sometimes comforting herself with a sly pinch of snuff,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</a></span>
or, when sunbeams and customers were scarce, nodding drowsily
over the daily papers.</p>

<p class="new_para">Aunt Hepsy <em>had</em> been a beauty, and her pretty face had won
her a thriftless husband, of whom champagne and cigars had
long since kindly relieved her. And though Time had since
forced her to apply to the perruquier, he had gallantly made
atonement by leaving her in the undisputed possession of a
pair of very brilliant black eyes. Add to this a certain air of
coquetry, in the fanciful twist of her gay-colored turban, and
the disposal of the folds of her lace kerchief over her ample
English bust&mdash;and you have a faithful daguerreotype of &ldquo;Aunt
Hepsy.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="new_para">From the window of her little shop she could look out upon
the blue waters of the bay, where lay moored the gallant
ships, from whose tall masts floated the stars and stripes, and
whose jolly captains might often be seen in Aunt Hepsy&#8217;s shop,
exchanging compliments and snuff, and their heavy voices
heard, recounting long Neptune yarns, and declaring to the buxom
widow that nothing but the little accident of their being
already spliced for life, prevented their immediately spreading
sail with her for the port of Matrimony. Aunt Hepsy usually
frowned at this, and shook her turbaned head menacingly, but
immediately neutralized it, by offering to mend a rip in their
gloves, or replace a truant button on their overcoats.</p>

<p class="new_para">It was very odd, how universally popular was Aunt Hepsy.
She had any number of places to &ldquo;take tea,&rdquo; beside a standing
invitation from half-a-dozen families, to Christmas and Thanksgiving
dinners, and to New-Year&#8217;s suppers. She had an eligible<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</a></span>
seat in church, gratis; an inexhaustible bottle of sherry for
her often infirmities; fresh pies on family baking days, newspapers
for stormy day reading; tickets to menageries, and invitations
to picnics.</p>

<p class="new_para">She always procured lodgings at a cheaper rate than anybody
else; had the pleasantest room in the house at that, the warmest
seat at table, the strongest cup of coffee, the brownest slice of
toast, the latest arrival of buckwheats, the second joint of the
turkey, and the only surviving piece of pie. To be sure, she
always praised ugly babies, asked old maids why they <em>would</em>
be so cruel as to persist in remaining unmarried, entreated
hen-pecked husbands to use their powerful influence over their
wives to secure to her their custom; begged the newly fledged
clergyman to allow her a private perusal of his last Sunday&#8217;s
able discourse; complimented ambitious Esaus on the luxuriant
growth of their very incipient, and microscopically perceptible
whiskers; asked dilapidated, rejected widowers, when they intended
taking their choice of a wife out of a bevy of rosy girls,
and declared to Editors that she might as well try to get along
without her looking glass, as without their interesting newspapers.</p>

<p class="new_para">One day, the little shop was shut up. Nine o&#8217;clock came&mdash;eleven
o&#8217;clock, and the shutters were still closed, and Aunt Hepsy
so punctual, too! What <em>could</em> it mean? Old Mrs. Brown
was ready to have fits because she couldn&#8217;t get another skein
of yarn to finish her old man&#8217;s stockings. Little Pat Dolan
had roared himself black in the face, because he couldn&#8217;t spend
his cent to buy some maple sugar; and the little match<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</a></span>
girl stood shivering at the corner for a place to warm her poor
benumbed fingers, while the disappointed captains stamped
their feet on the snow, stuffed their cheeks with quids, and said it
was &ldquo;deuced funny,&rdquo; and an old maid, opposite, who had long
prayed that Aunt Hepsy&#8217;s reign might be shortened, laid her
skinny forefinger on her hooked nose, and rolled up the whites
of her eyes like a chicken with the pip.</p>

<p class="new_para">It was no great enigma, (at any rate not after you found it
out!) Rich old Mr. Potts ventured into Aunt Hepsy&#8217;s shop,
one day, to buy a watch-ribbon. He was very deaf; so Aunt
Hepsy had to come round the counter to wait upon him, and
the upshot of it was, that she and Cupid together, hailed him
through an ear-trumpet; and all I know about it is, that they
have now a legalized right to a mutual pillow and snuff-box,
and that the little shop window still remains unopened, while
the old maid hisses between her teeth, as Aunt Hepsy rolls by
in her carriage, &ldquo;How do you suppose she did it?&rdquo;</p>

<h2>THOUGHTS AT CHURCH.</h2>
<p class="new_para">I have an old-fashioned way of entering church, before the
bells begin to chime. I enjoy the quiet, brooding stillness. I
love to think of the many words of holy cheer that have fallen
there, from heaven-missioned lips, and folded themselves like
snow-white wings over the weary heart of despair. I love to think
of the sinless little ones, whose pearly temples have here been
laved at the baptismal font. I love to think of the weak, yet
strong ones, who have tearfully tasted the consecrated cup, on
which is written, &ldquo;Do this in remembrance of me.&rdquo; I love to
think of those self-forgetting, self-exiled, who, counting all things
naught for Gethsemane&#8217;s dear sake, are treading foreign shores,
to say to the soul-fettered Pagan, &ldquo;Behold the Lamb of God.&rdquo; I
love to think of the loving hearts that at yonder altar have
throbbed, side by side, while the holy man of God pronounced
&ldquo;the twain one.&rdquo; I love to think of the seraph smile of which
death itself was powerless to rob the dead saint, over whose
upturned face, to which the sunlight lent such mocking glow,
the words, &ldquo;Dust to dust,&rdquo; fell upon the pained ear of love.
I love, as I sit here, to list through the half open vestry door,
to the hymning voices of happy Sabbath scholars, sweet as the
timid chirp of morn&#8217;s first peeping bird. I love to hear their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</a></span>
tiny feet, as they patter down the aisle, and mark the earnest
gaze of questioning childhood. I love to see the toil-hardened
hand of labor brush off the penitential tear. I love&mdash;&ldquo;<em>our</em>
minister.&rdquo; How very sad he looks to-day. Are his parish
unsympathetic? Does the laborer&#8217;s &ldquo;hire&rdquo; come tardily and
grudgingly to the overtasked, faithful servant? Do censorious,
dissatisfied spirits watch and wait for his halting?</p>

<p class="new_para">Now he rises and says, slowly&mdash;musically, &ldquo;The Lord is
my shepherd, I shall not want.&rdquo; Why at such sweet, soul-resting
words, do his tears overflow? Why has his voice
such a heart quiver? Ah! there is a vacant seat in the pastor&#8217;s
pew. A little golden head, that last Sabbath gladdened
our eyes like a gleam of sunlight, lies dreamlessly pillowed beneath
the coffin lid: gleeful eyes have lost their brightness:
cherry lips are wan and mute, and beneath her sable vail the
lonely mother sobs. And so the father&#8217;s lip quivers, and for a
moment nature triumphs. Then athwart the gloomy cloud
flashes the bow of promise. He wipes away the blinding tears,
and with an angel smile, and upward glance, he says, &ldquo;<em>Though
he slay me, yet will I trust in Him.</em>&rdquo;</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p class="new_para"><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</a></span></p>

<h2>THE BROTHERS.</h2>
<p class="new_para">Close the door. One would scarcely think, in this luxurious
atmosphere, that we had left mid-winter behind us. The
warm air is heavy with the odor of blossoming greenhouse
plants, over whose fragrant clusters a tiny fountain tosses its
sparkling spray: bright-winged, sweet-voiced canaries dart, like
flashes of sunlight, through the dark green foliage: beautiful
are those sculptured infants, cheek to cheek, over whose dimpled
limbs the crimson drapery throws such a rosy glow: beautiful
is that shrinking Venus, with her pure, chaste brow, and
Eve-like grace: lovely those rare old pictures, to the artistic
eye: beautiful that recumbent statuette of the peerless, proud
&ldquo;Pauline.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="new_para">Hush! tread softly; on yonder couch a gentleman lies
sleeping. His crimson velvet cap has fallen back from his
broad white forehead; his long curving lashes droop heavily
upon his cheek, and his Grecian profile is as faultless as a sculptor&#8217;s
dream. Pity, that the stain of sensuality should have left
so legible an impress there.</p>

<p class="new_para">A servant enters, bearing a note upon a silver tray. His
master languidly opens a pair of large dark eyes, and beckons
him to approach. As he breaks the seal, a contemptuous sneer<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</a></span>
disfigures his handsome lip, and an angry flush mounts to his
brow. Motioning the servant away, he crushes the note between
his fingers, muttering,&mdash;&ldquo;No&mdash;no&mdash;as he has made his
bed, so let him lie in it.&rdquo; Then walking once or twice rapidly
across the room, he takes up a small volume, and throws himself
again upon the velvet couch. He does not turn the leaves, and
if you peep over his shoulder, you will see that the book is upside
down. His thoughts are far away. He remembers a bright-eyed,
open-browed, guileless-hearted brother, whom early orphanage
had thrown upon his fraternal care; whose trusting
nature he had perverted; whose listening ear he had poisoned
with specious sophistries and worldly maxims; whom he had
introduced to the wine party, where female virtue was held in
derision, and to the &ldquo;green room,&rdquo; where the foreign <em><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">danseuse</span></em>
understood well how to play her part; whom he had initiated
into modern follies and dissipations, and then launched upon
the Charybdis of fashionable society, without chart, or rudder,
or compass, other than his own headstrong passions and unbridled
will.</p>

<p class="new_para">Soon came a rumor, at first vague and undefined, and then
voraciously seized upon and circulated by Paul Pry penny-a-liners,
(who recked little, in their avidity for a paragraph, of
broken-hearted mothers or despairing gray-haired fathers,) of
a true heart that had been betrayed, of a disgraced household,
of a fair brow that must henceforth walk the earth shame-branded.
Then from his avenging pursuers the rash boy fled
for refuge to him who had first turned his youthful footsteps
aside from truth and honor. He was repulsed with scorn; not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</a></span>
because he had wronged his own soul and hers whose star had
forever set in night, but because he had not more skilfully and
secretly woven the meshes for his victim.</p>

<p class="new_para">Across the seas, amid the reckless debauchery of God-forgetting
Paris, the miserable boy sought oblivion; welcoming
with desperate eagerness the syren Pleasure, in every chameleon
shape that could stifle conscience or drown torturing memory.
Sometimes by a lucky throw of the dice he was enabled
to shine as the Adonis of some ball, or theatre, or gay saloon:
sometimes destitute as the humblest <em><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">chiffonier</span></em>, who suns
himself in the public square, and solicits charity of the indifferent
passer-by. In the rosy glow of morning, the bright
stars paled while Harry sat at the enticing gaming table, till
even those accustomed to breathe the polluted atmosphere of
those gates of perdition, turned shuddering away, from the
fiendish look of that youthful face.</p>

<p class="new_para">Nature revenged herself at last. Wearisome days of sickness
came, and he who was nurtured in luxury, was dependent
upon the charity of grudging strangers.</p>

<p class="new_para">Oh! what a broad, clear beam eternity throws upon the
crooked by-paths of sin! how like swift visions pass the long
forgotten prayer at the blessed mother&#8217;s knee; the long-forgotten
words of Holy Writ; the soothing vesper hymn, of holy
time; the first cautious, retrograding step&mdash;the gradual searing
of conscience, till the barrier between right and wrong is ruthlessly
trampled under foot; the broken resolutions, the misspent
years, the wasted energies; the sins against one&#8217;s own
soul, the sins against others; the powerless wish to pray, &#8217;mid<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</a></span>
paroxysms of bodily pain; the clinging hold on life&mdash;the anxious
glance at the physician&mdash;the thrilling question, &ldquo;Doctor,
is it life or death?&rdquo;</p>

<p class="new_para">Poor Harry! amid the incoherent ravings of delirium,
the good little grisette learned his sad history. Her little
French heart was touched with pity. Through her representations,
on his partial restoration to health, a sufficient sum was
subscribed by the American consul, and some of his generous
countrymen, to give him the last chance for his life, by sending
him to breathe again his native air. Earnestly he prayed that
the sea might not be his sepulchre.</p>

<p class="new_para">Tearfully he welcomed the first sight of his native shore.
Tremblingly he penned those few lines to the brother whose
face he so yearned to see&mdash;and on whose fraternal breast it
would seem almost easy to die. Anxiously he waited the result,
turning restlessly from side to side, till beaded drops of
agony started from his pallid temples. Walter would not refuse
his <em>last</em> request. No&mdash;no. The proud man would at
least, at the grave&#8217;s threshold, forget that &ldquo;vulgar rumor&rdquo; had
coupled his patrician name with disgrace. Oh, why had the
messenger such leaden footsteps? when life and strength like
hour-glass sands, were fleeting! A step is heard upon the
stairs! A faint flush, like the rosy tinting of a sea-shell, brightens
the pallid face.</p>

<p class="new_para">&ldquo;No answer, sir,&rdquo; gruffly says the messenger.</p>

<p class="new_para">A smothered groan of anguish, and Harry turns his face to
the wall, and tears, such only as despair can shed, bedew his
pillow.</p>

<p class="new_para"><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</a></span></p>

<p class="new_para">&ldquo;<em>Do</em> go, dear Walter; &#8217;tis your own brother who asks it.
If he has sinned, has he not also suffered? We all so err, so
need forgiveness. Oh, take back those hasty words; let him
die on your breast, for <em>my</em> sake, Walter,&rdquo; said the sweet pleader,
as her tears fell over the hand she pressed.</p>

<p class="new_para">&ldquo;That&#8217;s my own husband,&rdquo; said the happy Mary, as she
saw him relent. &ldquo;Go <em>now</em>, dear Walter. Take away the sting
of those cruel words, while yet you may, and carry him these
sweet flowers, he used to love, from me. Quick, dear Walter.&rdquo;</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p class="new_para">&ldquo;This way, sir, this way. Up another flight,&rdquo; said the guide,
gazing admiringly at the fine figure before him, enveloped in
a velvet Spanish cloak. &ldquo;Second door to the left, sir. Maybe
the gentleman&#8217;s asleep now; he&#8217;s been very quiet for some
time. Seen trouble, sir, I reckon. &#8217;Tis not age that has drawn
those lines on his handsome face. He&#8217;s not long for this world,
God rest his soul. That&#8217;s right, sir; that&#8217;s the door. Good
day, sir.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="new_para">Walter stood with his finger on the latch. He had at all
times a nervous shrinking from sickness&mdash;a fastidious horror
of what he termed &ldquo;disagreeables.&rdquo; He half repented that he
had suffered a woman&#8217;s tears to unsettle his purpose. Perhaps
Harry would reproach him. (His own conscience was prompter
to that thought.) There he stood, irresolutely twirling Mary&#8217;s
lovely flowers in his nervous grasp.</p>

<p class="new_para">If Harry should reproach him!</p>

<p class="new_para">Slowly he opened the door. The flowers fell from his hand!<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</a></span>
Was that attenuated, stiffened form his own, warm-hearted,
bright-eyed, gallant young brother?</p>

<p class="new_para">&ldquo;Reproach?&rdquo;</p>

<p class="new_para">Oh, Walter, there is no &ldquo;reproach&rdquo; like that passionless upturned
face; no words so crushing as the silence of those
breathless lips; no misery like the thought that those we have
injured are forever blind to our gushing tears, and deaf to our
sobs of repentance.</p>

old letters, without having his married eyes peeping over your
shoulder; curious he never allows you to ride on horseback,
though everybody says you have just the figure for it; curious
he always sends his partner on all the little business trips of the
firm; curious such an ugly frown comes over his face when
he sees certain cabalistic marks in a masculine hand, in the
margin of your favorite poet; curious that he will not let you
name your youngest boy Harry, unless you tell him your confidential
reasons; curious he is always most gracious to the
most uninteresting men who visit the house; and <em>very</em> curious,
and decidedly disagreeable, that whenever you ask him for
money, he is so busy reading the newspaper that he can&#8217;t hear
you.</p>

<h2>THE ADVANTAGES OF A HOUSE IN A FASHIONABLE SQUARE.</h2>
<p class="new_para">&ldquo;Whom did you say wished to see me, Bridget?&rdquo;</p>

<p class="new_para">The broad-faced Irish girl handed her mistress a card.</p>

<p class="new_para"><span class="correction"
title="Transcriber&apos;s Note: Originally the single opening quotation mark came before the double opening quotation mark.">&ldquo;&lsquo;Mrs.</span> John Hunter!&rsquo; was there <em>ever</em> anything so unfortunate?
had she called on any other day in the week, I should
have been prepared to receive her, but of a &lsquo;washing day,&rsquo;
when nothing but a calico wrapper stands Master George&#8217;s
clawings and climbings; when the nursery maid is in the kitchen,
and the baby on my hands for the day; when my &lsquo;Honiton
collar&rsquo; is in soak, the parlor window curtains in the wash-tub,
and the dimensions of the whole family, big and little, are flapping
on the clothes-line, displaying their rents and patches in
full view of the parlor windows! Was there ever anything so
unfortunate? What <em>could</em> induce Mrs. John Hunter to call on
a washing day?&rdquo;</p>

<p class="new_para">But what was &ldquo;washing day&rdquo; to Mrs. John Hunter, who
lived in St. John&#8217;s Square, kept four servants, and patronized a
laundry? What did she know of Mondays&#8217; picked up dinners
and littered parlors, cluttered china closet, and untidied nurseries?
Mrs. John Hunter, who came down to breakfast every<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</a></span>
morning in a fawn-colored silk morning dress, trimmed with
cherry, over an elaborately embroidered white skirt; in a
cobweb lace cap, silk stockings, and the daintiest of Parisian
toilette slippers; how could <em>she</em> see the necessity of going down
cellar, after breakfast, to see if the pork was under brine, the
pickle jar covered, and the preserves unfermented? What
did <em>she</em> know about washing up breakfast-cups, polishing the
silver sugar bowl, filling the astral lamp, counting up the silver
forks and spoons, or mending that little threadbare place in the
carpet, that would soon widen into an ugly rent, if neglected?
What did she know about washing children&#8217;s faces for school,
or finding their missing mittens, or seeing that Webster&#8217;s spelling
book and a big apple were safely stowed away in their
satchels? How did she (whose family broadcloth the tailor
mended) know that Monday was always the day when husbands
threw their coats into wives&#8217; lap &ldquo;for just one stitch,&rdquo;
(which translated, means new sleeve-linings, new facings for the
flaps, a new set of buttons down the front, and a general resuscitation
of dilapidated button-holes.) How did she know that
the baby always got up a fit of colic on washing days, and
made it a point to dispense with its usual forenoon nap?&mdash;that
all the collectors for benevolent societies, and bores in general,
preferred it to any other day in the calendar?&mdash;that school
teachers always selected it to ferule children for sneezing without
permission&mdash;that milkmen never could spare you, on that
day, your usual share of milk by two quarts&mdash;that the coal,
potatoes, starch, soap, molasses, and vinegar always gave out
on Monday&mdash;that &ldquo;the minister&rdquo; always selected it for his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</a></span>
annual call, and country cousins for a &ldquo;protracted meeting?&rdquo;
How should the patrician, Mrs. John Hunter, know all that?</p>

<p class="new_para">There she sat in the parlor taking notes, after the usual fashion
of lady callers, while Mrs. John Smith hurriedly tied on
her bonnet, to hide her disheveled tresses, threw on a shawl,
and made her appearance in the parlor as if &ldquo;just returned from
a walk.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="new_para">How their tongues ran! how fashions and gossip were discussed;
how Mrs. Smith admired Mrs. Hunter&#8217;s new dress
hat; how the latter lady advised Mrs. Smith to &ldquo;insist on her
husband&#8217;s moving from such an undesirable neighborhood into
a more aristocratic locality;&rdquo; and how Mrs. Smith wondered
that the idea had never struck her before; and how Mrs. Hunter
told her that of course Mr. Smith would refuse at first, but
that she must either worry him into it, or seize upon some moment
of conjugal weakness to extort a binding promise from
him to that effect; and how the little wife blushed to find herself
conniving at this feminine piece of diabolism.</p>

<p class="new_para">Mrs. John Smith&#8217;s husband commenced life in a provision
store. He was well acquainted with cleavers, white aprons,
and spare-ribs&mdash;was on hand early and late to attend to business&mdash;trusted
nobody&mdash;lived within his income, and consequently
made money.</p>

<p class="new_para">Miss Mary Wood kept a dressmaker&#8217;s establishment just
over the way. Very industriously she sat through the long
summer days, drooping her pretty golden ringlets over that
never-ending succession of dresses. Patiently she &ldquo;took in,&rdquo;
and &ldquo;let out,&rdquo; bias-ed, flounced, tucked, gathered and plaited,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</a></span>
at the weathercock option of her customers. Uneasily she
leaned her head against her little window at sundown, and
earnestly Mr. John Smith wished he could reprieve forever
from such drudgery those taper little fingers. Very tempting
was the little basket of early strawberries, covered with fresh
green leaves, that went across the way to her one bright summer
morning&mdash;and as red as the strawberries, and quite as
tempting, looked Miss Mary&#8217;s cheek to Mr. John Smith, as she
sat at the window, reading the little billet-doux which he slily
tucked into one corner.</p>

<p class="new_para">The milkman wondered why Mr. Smith had grown so particular
about the flowers in the bouquets his little grand-daughter
plucked for sale, and why there must <em>always</em> be &ldquo;a rose-bud in
it.&rdquo; Miss Rosa Violet couldn&#8217;t imagine what ailed her dressmaker,
Miss Wood, (who was always so scrupulous in executing
orders,) to make her boddice round, when she told her so
particularly to make it pointed. The little sewing girls employed
in Miss Wood&#8217;s shop were &ldquo;afraid she was getting crazy,&rdquo;
she smiled so often to herself, broke so many needles, and
made so many mistakes in settling up their accounts on pay
day; and very great was their astonishment one day, after finishing
a pretty bridal dress, to find that Miss Wood was to
wear it herself to church the very next Sunday!</p>

<p class="new_para">One bright June morning found the little dressmaker in a
nice, two story brick house, furnished with every comfort, and
some luxuries; for the warm-hearted John thought nothing half
good enough for his little golden-haired bride. As time passed
on, other little luxuries were added; including two nice, fat, dim<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</a></span>pled
babies; and within the last year John had bought the
house they lived in, and at Mary&#8217;s suggestion introduced gas,
to lighten the labors of the servant, and also added a little
bathing-room to the nursery. His table was well provided&mdash;the
mother&#8217;s and children&#8217;s wardrobes ample, and not a
husband in Yankee land was prouder or happier than John Smith,
when on a sunshiny Sunday, he walked to church with his
pretty wife, whose golden curls still gleamed from beneath her
little blue bonnet, followed by Katy and Georgy with their
shining rosy faces, and pretty Sunday dresses.</p>

<p class="new_para">It was quite time the honeymoon should wane, but still it
showed no signs of decrease. Little bouquets still perfumed
Mary&#8217;s room. John still sprung to pick up her handkerchief,
or aid her in putting on her cloak or shawl. The anniversary
of their wedding day always brought her a kind little
note, with some simple remembrancer. Trifles, do you call
these? Ah, a wife&#8217;s happiness is made or marred by just such
&ldquo;trifles.&rdquo;</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p class="new_para">&ldquo;Katy will make somebody&#8217;s heart ache one of these days&rdquo;,
said John Smith to his wife. <span class="correction"
title="Transcriber&apos;s Note: Opening double quotation mark added.">&ldquo;Katy</span> will be a beauty. Did you
hear me, Mary?&rdquo;</p>

<p class="new_para">&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Mary, drooping her bright ringlets till they swept
John&#8217;s cheek, &ldquo;and I was thinking how I hoped she would
marry well, and whether it would not be better for us to move
into a more genteel neighborhood, and form a new set of acquaintances.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="new_para">&ldquo;<em>My</em> little wife getting ambitious!&rdquo; said John, smoothing her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</a></span>
ringlets back from her white forehead; &ldquo;and where would you
like to live, Mary?&rdquo;</p>

<p class="new_para">&ldquo;St. John&#8217;s Square is a nice place,&rdquo; said the little wife,
timidly.</p>

<p class="new_para">&ldquo;Yes; but my dear Mary, rents there are enormous, and
those large houses require a greater outlay of money than you
have any idea of. The furniture which looks pretty and in
good taste here, would be quite shabby in such an elegant establishment.
The pretty de laine, which fits your little round figure
so charmingly, must give place to a silk or brocade. Katy
and Georgy must doff their simple dresses, for velvet and embroidery;
broad-faced, red-fisted Bridget must make way for a
French cook. The money which I have placed in the bank for
a nest-egg for you and the children in case of my death, must
be withdrawn to meet present demands. But we will talk of
this another time: good-by Mary, dear; not even your dear
face must tempt me away from business; good-by,&rdquo; and
he kissed his hand to her, as he walked rapidly out the
door.</p>

<p class="new_para">But somehow or other Mary&#8217;s words kept ringing in John&#8217;s
ears. It was very true Katy must be married some day, and
then he ran over the circle of their acquaintance; the Stubbses,
and the Joneses, and the Jenkinses&mdash;good enough in their way,
but (he confessed to himself) <em>not just the thing for his Katy</em>.
John was ambitious too: Mary was right; they ought to consider
that Katy would soon be a woman.</p>

<p class="new_para">It is not to be supposed because John Smith never sported
white kids, save on his wedding day, that he was not a man of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</a></span>
taste; by no means. Not an artistic touch of Mary&#8217;s feminine
fingers, from the twist of a ringlet or ribbon to the draping
of a curtain, the judicious disposal of a fine engraving, or the
harmonious blending of colors in a mantel bouquet, escaped him.
It was his joy and pride to see her glide about his home, beautifying
almost unconsciously everything she touched; and then,
he remembered when she was ill, and Bridget had the oversight
of the parlors&mdash;what a different air they had; how awkwardly
the chairs looked plastered straight against the wall&mdash;how
ugly the red cloth all awry on the centre table; what
a string-y look the curtains had, after her clumsy fingers had
passed over them. Yes, Mary would grace a house in St.
John&#8217;s Square, and if it would make her any happier to go there
(and here he glanced at his ledger)&mdash;why, go she should&mdash;for
she was just the prettiest, and dearest, and most loving little
Mary who ever answered to that poetical name. What would
full coffers avail him, if Mary should die?&mdash;and she might die
first. His health was good&mdash;his business was good. Mary and
Katy <em>should</em> live in St John&#8217;s Square.</p>

<p class="new_para">Mary and Katy <em>did</em> live in St John&#8217;s Square. The upholsterer
crammed as many hundreds as possible into the drawing
rooms, in the shape of vis-a-vis antique chairs, velvet sofas, damask
curtains, mirrors, tapestry, carpets, and a thousand other
nick-nacks, too numerous to mention: then the blinds and curtains
shut out the glad sunlight, lest the warm beams should
fade out the rich tints of the carpets and curtains, and left it as
fine and as gloomy as any other fashionable drawing room.
There was a very pretty prospect from Mary&#8217;s chamber win<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</a></span>dows,
but she never allowed herself to enjoy it, after Mrs. John
Hunter told her, that it was considered &ldquo;decidedly snobbish to
be seen at the front window.&rdquo; The Smiths took their meals in
a gloomy basement, where gas was indispensable at mid-day.
Mary was constantly in fear that the servants would spoil the
pictures and statues in the parlor, so she concluded to sweep and
dust it herself, before there was any probability of Mrs. John
Hunter&#8217;s being awake in the morning. As this was something
of a tax, she and Mr. Smith and the children kept out of it,
except on Sundays and when company called, burrowing
under ground the residue of the time in the afore-mentioned
basement.</p>

<p class="new_para">Directly opposite Mrs. Smith lived Mrs. Vivian Grey, the
leader of the aristocracy (so Mrs. Hunter informed her) in St.
John&#8217;s Square. It was a great thing to be noticed by Mrs.
Vivian Grey. Mrs. Hunter sincerely hoped she would patronise
Mrs. Smith. Mrs. Hunter, after a minute survey, pronounced
Mrs. Smith&#8217;s establishment quite <em><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">comme il faut</span></em>, but
suggested that a <em>real</em> cachemire should be added as soon as
possible to Mrs. Smith&#8217;s wardrobe, as Mrs. Grey considered
that article quite indispensable to a woman of fashion. She
also suggested that Mrs. Smith should delicately hint to her
husband the propriety of his engaging a man servant, which appendage
was necessary to give a certain <em><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">distingué</span></em> finish to the
establishment; an Irishman would do, if well trained, but a
<em>black</em> man was more fashionable, provided he was not <em>green</em>&mdash;and
Mrs. Hunter smiled at her own wit.</p>

<p class="new_para">The cachemire was added&mdash;so was the black servant-man.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</a></span>
Katy no longer skipped and jumped, but minced in corsets and
whalebone. She never <em>ate</em> unless at a private lunch with
mamma. Mr. John Smith staid late at his counting-room, and
looked anxious, and two ugly lines made their appearance on
Mrs. Mary&#8217;s fair forehead. The French cook gave away provisions
enough to feed an entire family of French emigrants.
The black man-servant pulled up his dicky and informed Mrs.
Smith that it was at the price of his reputation to live with a
family who dispensed with the use of finger bowls, and the
house-maid (who had the honor of being descended from
the establishment of Mrs. Vivian Grey) declined remaining
with a family who didn&#8217;t keep a private carriage.</p>

<p class="new_para">Mrs. Vivian Grey was <em>not</em> baited by the real cachemire, and
her son, little Julius Grey, a precocious youth of ten, told little
George Smith that his mamma had forbidden him playing marbles
with a boy whose father had kept a provision store.</p>

<p class="new_para">A scurrilous penny paper published a burlesque of Mrs.
Smith&#8217;s first grand party, on the coming out of Miss Katy, in
which, among other allusions to Mr. Smith&#8217;s former occupation,
the ball-room was said to be &ldquo;elegantly festooned with
sausages.&rdquo; This added &ldquo;the last ounce to the camel&#8217;s back;&rdquo;
even Mrs. Hunter&#8217;s tried friendship was not proof against such
a test.</p>

<p class="new_para">A council of war was called. Mrs. Smith begged her husband,
as her repentant arms encircled his dicky, to buy a place
in the country. John very gladly consented to turn his plebeian
back forever on the scene of their humiliation; and what with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</a></span>
strawberries and cherries, peaches, pic-nics, early rising and
light hearts, the Smith family have once more recovered their
equanimity, and can afford to laugh when &ldquo;St. John&#8217;s Square&rdquo;
and Mrs. John Hunter are mentioned.</p>

other sex, would be only a dark and cheerless void.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="new_para"><em>Which</em> &ldquo;other sex?&rdquo; Don&#8217;t be so obscure. Dr. Beecher

Think of female friendship! Two women joining the Mutual

Should they ever wear an outside coat, with the

a mammoth bow on their neck-ties; or a turnover dickey; or
a watch-chain; or a ring on the little finger?&mdash;or any other

I politely request them all to touch their hats, instead of jerking
their heads, when they bowed? Wouldn&#8217;t I coax them to
read me poetry till they had the bronchitis? Wouldn&#8217;t they
play on the flute, and sing the soul out of me? And then if

<h2>SOLILOQUY OF MR. BROADBRIM.</h2>

puffs for the voice of the crowd, and considers herself on
the top round of the literary ladder. It will take me to
take the wind out of her sails. I&#8217;ll dissect her, before I&#8217;m a

approve her style; never did. It&#8217;s astonishing to me that the
editor of The Green Twig dare countenance it, when he knows
a man of my influence could annihilate her with one stroke of
my pen. She has talent of a certain inferior order, but nothing
to speak of. She&#8217;s an unsafe model to follow; will lead her
tribe of imitators into tremendous mistakes. It&#8217;s a religious
duty for a conspicuous sentinel, like myself, on Zion&#8217;s walls, to
sound the blast of alarm;&mdash;can&#8217;t answer it to my conscience to
be silent any longer. It might be misconstrued. The welfare

very decided expression of my disapprobation. I&#8217;m sorry to
annihilate her, but when Ezekiel Broadbrim makes up his mind
what is the path of duty, a bright seraph couldn&#8217;t stop him.
Perhaps I may pour a drop of the balm of consolation after<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</a></span>wards,

<h2>WILLY GREY.</h2>
<p class="new_para">A stern, unyielding, line-and-plummet, May-flower descendant,
was old Farmer Grey, of Allantown, Connecticut. Many a
crop had he planted, many a harvest had he garnered in, since
he first became owner of Glen Farm. During that time, that
respected individual, &ldquo;the oldest inhabitant,&rdquo; could not remember
ever to have seen him smile. The village children shied
close to the stone wall, and gave him a wide berth, when he
passed. Even the cats and dogs laid their ears back, and crept
circumspectly by him, with one eye on his whip-lash.</p>

<p class="new_para">Farmer Grey considered it acceptable to the God who
painted the rainbow, and expanded the lily, and tinted the rose,
to walk the bright earth with his head bowed like a bulrush,
and his soul clad in sackcloth. No mercy fell from the lips of
<em>his</em> imaginary Saviour; no compassion breathed in His voice;
no love beamed in His eye; His sword of justice was never
sheathed.</p>

<p class="new_para">The old farmer&#8217;s wife was a gentle, dependent creature, a
delicate vine, springing up in a sterile soil, reaching forth its
tendrils vainly, for some object to cling to. God, in his mercy,
twined them lovingly around a human blossom. Little Willy
partook of his mother&#8217;s sensitive, poetical nature. A yearning<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</a></span>
spirit looked out from the fathomless depths of his earnest
eyes. Only eight short summers the gentle mother soothed
her boy&#8217;s childish pains, and watched his childish slumbers.
While <em>he</em> grew in strength and beauty, <em>her</em> eye waxed dim, and
her step grew slow and feeble.</p>

<p class="new_para">And so sweet memories were only left to little Willy,&mdash;dear,
loving eyes, whose glance ever met his on waking; a
fair, caressing hand, that wiped away his April tears; a low,
gentle voice, sweet to his childish ear as a seraph&#8217;s hymning.</p>

<p class="new_para">Willy&#8217;s father told him that &ldquo;his mother had gone to Heaven,&rdquo;
John, the plough-boy, said &ldquo;she was lying in the church-yard.&rdquo;
Willy could not understand this. He only knew that
the house had grown dark and empty, and that his heart ached
when he stayed there; and so he wandered out in the little
garden, (his mother&#8217;s garden;) but the flowers looked dreary,
too; and her pretty rose-vine lay trailing its broken buds and
blighted blossoms in the dust.</p>

<p class="new_para">Then Willy crept up to his father&#8217;s side, and looked up in
his face, but there was something there that made him afraid
to lay his little hand upon his knee, or climb into his lap, or in
any way unburden his little heart; so he turned away, more
sorrowful than before, and wandered into his mother&#8217;s chamber,
and climbed up in her chair, and opened her drawer, to look at
her comb and hair brush; and then he went to the closet, and
passed his little hand, caressingly, over her empty dresses, and
leaning his little curly head against them, sobbed himself to
sleep.</p>

<p class="new_para">By and by, as years passed on, and the child grew older, he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</a></span>
learned to wander out in the woods and fields, and unbosom his
little yearning heart to Nature. Reposing on her breast, listening
to the music of her thousand voices, his unquiet spirit
was soothed as with a mother&#8217;s lullaby. With kindling eye,
he watched the vivid lightnings play; or, saw the murky east
flush, like a timid bride, into rosy day; or, beheld the shining
folds of western clouds fade softly into twilight; or, gazed at
the Queen of Night, as she cut her shining path through the
cloudy sky; or, questioned, with earnest eyes, the glittering stars.</p>

<p class="new_para">All this but ill pleased the old farmer. He looked upon the
earth only with an eye to tillage; upon the sloping hill, with
its pine-crowned summit, only with an eye to timber; upon
the changeful skies, only as reservoirs for moistening and warming
his crops; upon the silver streams, that laced the emerald
meadows, only as channels for irrigation; upon the climbing
vine, as an insidious foe to joists, and beams, and timbers; and
upon flowers, only as perfumed aristocrats, crowding and
over-topping the free-soil democracy of cabbage, onions, and
potatoes.</p>

<p class="new_para">In vain poor Will tried to get up, &ldquo;to order,&rdquo; an enthusiasm
for self-acting hay-cutters, patent plows, rakes, hoes, and harrows.
In vain, when Sunday came, and he was put &ldquo;on the
limits,&rdquo; did the old farmer, with a face ten-fold more ascetic
than the cowled monk, strive to throw a pall of gloom over
that free, glad spirit, by rehearsing, in his ear, a creed which
would forever close the gate of heaven on every dissenter, or
inculcate doctrines, which, if believed, would fill our lunatic
asylums with the frantic wailings of despair.</p>

<p class="new_para"><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</a></span></p>

<p class="new_para">Restlessly did Will, with cramped limbs and fettered spirit,
sit out the tedious hours of that holy day, which should be the
&ldquo;most blessed of all the seven,&rdquo; and watch, with impatient eye,
the last golden beam of the Sabbath sun sink slowly down behind
the western hills.</p>

<p class="new_para">Oh, well-meaning, but mistaken, parent! let but one loving
smile play over those frigid lips: let but one tear of sympathy
flood that stony eye: let but <em>one drop</em> from that overflowing
fountain of love, that wells up in the bosom of the Infinite,
moisten the parched soil of that youthful heart! Open those
arms but once, and clasp him to the paternal heart; for
even now, his chafed spirit, like a caged bird, flutters against
its prison bars; even now, the boy&#8217;s unquiet ear catches the
far-off hum of the busy world: even now, his craving heart
beats wildly for the voice of human love!</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p class="new_para">Weary feet, houseless nights, the scant meal, and the oft-repulsed
request: what are <em>they</em> to the strong nerve, and bounding
pulse, and hopeful heart of the young adventurer? Laurel
wreaths, dizzy places on Ambition&#8217;s heights, have not its aspirants
reached them by just such rugged steps?</p>

<p class="new_para">&ldquo;Will&rdquo; is in the city. Will sits upon the steps of the New
York City Hall, reading a penny paper: he has begged it from
a good-natured newsboy, who has also shared with him a huge
slice of gingerbread. As Will&#8217;s eye glances over the sheet, it
falls upon the following paragraph:</p>

<p class="new_para"><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</a></span></p>

<p class="new_para">&ldquo;PROSPECTUS OF THE WEEKLY CHRONICLE.</p>

<p class="new_para">&ldquo;The Weekly Chronicle is a paper founded on the demands
of the age for a first-class journal. It soars above all sectional
and personal considerations, and fearlessly proffers its feeble
aid, in developing the natural resources of the country, fostering
the genius of the people, rewarding meritorious effort in every
department of art, exalting virtue, however humble, and confounding
vice, however powerful. The editor and proprietor
of the Chronicle is Mr. Philanthropas Howard; office, No. 199
Cloud-street.</p>

<p class="new_para">&ldquo;Boy wanted immediately at the above office: one from the
country would be preferred.&rdquo;</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p class="new_para">Will threw down the paper, and started to his feet: &ldquo;199
Cloud-street?&rdquo; He asked orange-women; he asked image-boys;
he asked merchants; he asked clerks; he asked lawyers; he
asked clients; he investigated cellars; he explored attics;
he traveled through parks, and through alleys; till finally,
he coaxed a graceless, bare-footed urchin to shew him the
way.</p>

<p class="new_para">Mr. John Howard, editor and proprietor of the Weekly
Chronicle, went upon the principle of paying nothing where nothing
would pay, and paying as little as possible where he could
get something for next to nothing. It was a fixed principle and
confirmed practice with him, never to pay anything for contributions
to the Chronicle. He considered that the great advantage
that would accrue to an author from having his or her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</a></span>
articles in his paper, would be ample remuneration. At
the moment Will&#8217;s eye first fell upon him, he was reposing in
a huge leathern arm chair, in the corner of his sanctum. His
proportions very much resembled an apoplectic bag of flour,
surmounted by an apple. His head was ornamented with
sparse spires of fiery red hair; on his cheeks, a pair of cream-colored
whiskers were feebly struggling into life; and sundry tufts
of the same color, under his chin, shadowed forth his editorial
sympathy with the recent &ldquo;Beard Movement.&rdquo; Before him
was a table, of doubtful hue and architecture, laden with manuscripts,
accepted, rejected, and under consideration; letters of
all sizes, opened and unopened, prepaid and unpaid, saucy and
silly, defiant and deprecatory. There was also an inkstand,
crusted with dirt and cobwebs; a broken paper weight, pinning
down some bad money, paid by distant subscribers; a camphene
lamp, with a broken pedestal, propped up by a Directory on
one side, and Walker&#8217;s Dictionary on the other; sundry stumps
of cigars; a half-eaten apple; a rind of an orange; a lady&#8217;s
glove, and a box of bilious pills.</p>

<p class="new_para">Will stepped before him, and made known his errand. Mr.
John Howard looked at him, with a portentous scowl, inspected
him very much as he would a keg of doubtful mackerel, and
then referred him to the foreman of the office, Mr. Jack Punch.
Jack had been victimized, in the way of office boys, for an indefinite
period, with precocious city urchins, who smoked long
nines, talked politics, discussed theatricals, and knew more of
city haunts than the police themselves. Of course he lost no
time in securing a boy to whose verdant feet the plow-soil was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</a></span>
still clinging. Will&#8217;s business was to open the office at half
past six in the morning, sweep it out, make the fires, go to the
post-office for letters and exchanges, wrap up papers for new
subscribers, carry them to the post, and see that the mail was
properly &ldquo;got off.&rdquo; To all these requirements, Will immediately
subscribed.</p>

<p class="new_para">On Will&#8217;s daily tramps to and from the office, he was obliged
to pass <span class="correction" title="Transcriber&apos;s Note: Opening double quotation mark removed.">Lithe</span> &amp; Co.&#8217;s magnificent show window, where the
choicest pictures and engravings were constantly exposed for
sale. There he might be seen loitering, entranced and spellbound,
quite oblivious of the Chronicle, hour after hour, weaving
bright visions&mdash;building air castles, with which his overseer,
Mr. Jack Punch, had little sympathy. Yes; Will had
at length found out what he was made for. He knew <em>now</em> why
he had lain under the trees, of a bright summer day, watching
the fleecy clouds go sailing by, in such a dreamy rapture; why
the whispering leaves, and waving fields of grain, and drooping
branches of graceful trees, and the mirror-like beauty of the
placid lake, reflecting a mimic heaven; why the undulating
hills, and mist-wreathed valleys, with their wealth of leaf, and
buds and blossom, filled his eyes with tears and his soul with
untold joy, and why, when slumber sealed each weary lid under
the cottage eaves, he stood alone, hushing his very breath, awestruck,
beneath the holy stars.</p>

<p class="new_para">Poor Will, his occupation became so distasteful! Poor Will,
winged for a &ldquo;bird of paradise,&rdquo; and forced to be a mole, burrowing
under the earth, when he would fain try his new-found
pinions! To Jack&#8217;s intense disgust, he soon detected Will in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</a></span>
drawing rude sketches on bits of paper, stray wrappers,
and backs of letters; even the walls were &ldquo;done in crayons,&rdquo;
by the same mischievous fingers. His vision was so filled
&ldquo;with the curved line of beauty,&rdquo; that he was constantly committing
the most egregious blunders. He misplaced the bundles
of newspapers which he carried to the post-office; placing
the &ldquo;north&rdquo; packages on the &ldquo;south&rdquo; table, the east on the
north, the south on the east, &amp;c.; mixing them up generally
and indescribably and inextricably, so that the subscribers to
the &ldquo;Weekly Chronicle&rdquo; did not receive their papers with
that precision and regularity which is acknowledged to be desirable,
particularly in small country places, where the blacksmith&#8217;s
shop, the engine house, and &ldquo;the newspaper&rdquo; form a
trio not to be despised by the simple-hearted, primitive farmers.</p>

<p class="new_para">Jack, whose private opinion it was that he should have been
christened Job, being obliged to shoulder all the short-comings
of his assistants, and being worked up to a pitch of frenzy by
letters from incensed subscribers, which Mr. Howard constantly
thrust in his face, very unceremoniously ejected Will from the
premises, one morning, by a vigorous application of the toe of
his boot.</p>

<p class="new_para">The world was again a closed oyster to Will. How to
open it? that was the question. Our hero thought the best
place to consider the matter was at Lithe &amp; Co.&#8217;s shop-window.
Just as he reached it, a gentleman passed out of the shop,
followed by a lad bearing a small framed landscape. Perhaps
the gentleman was an artist! Perhaps he could employ him
in some way! Will resolved to follow him.</p>

<p class="new_para"><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</a></span></p>

<p class="new_para">Up one street and down another, round corners and through
squares&mdash;the gentleman&#8217;s long legs seemed to be shod with
the famed seven-leagued boots. At length he stopped before
the door of an unpretending looking building, and handing the
lad who accompanied him a bit of money, he took from him
the picture, and was just springing up the steps, when he lost
his balance, and the picture was jerked violently from his hand,
but only to be caught by the watchful Will, who restored it to
its owner uninjured.</p>

<p class="new_para">&ldquo;Thank you, my boy,&rdquo; said the gentleman, &ldquo;you have done
me a greater service than you think for;&rdquo; at the same time
offering him some money.</p>

<p class="new_para">&ldquo;No, I thank you,&rdquo; said Will, proudly. &ldquo;I do not wish to
be paid for it.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="new_para">&ldquo;As you please, Master Independence,&rdquo; replied the gentleman,
laughing; &ldquo;but is there no other way I can serve you?&rdquo;</p>

<p class="new_para">&ldquo;Are you an artist?&rdquo; asked Will.</p>

<p class="new_para"><span class="correction" title="Transcriber&apos;s Note: Opening double quotation mark removed.">The gentleman</span> raised his eyebrows, with a comical air, and
replied, &ldquo;Well, sometimes I think I am, and then, again, I don&#8217;t
know; but what if I were?&rdquo;</p>

<p class="new_para">&ldquo;I should <em>so</em> like to be an artist,&rdquo; said Will, the quick flush
mounting to his temples.</p>

<p class="new_para">&ldquo;You!&rdquo; exclaimed the gentleman, taking a minute survey of
Will&#8217;s nondescript <em><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">toute ensemble</span></em>, &ldquo;Do you ever draw?&rdquo;</p>

<p class="new_para">&ldquo;Sometimes,&rdquo; replied Will, &ldquo;when I can get a bit of charcoal,
and a white wall. I was just kicked out of the Chronicle
office for doing it.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="new_para"><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</a></span></p>

<p class="new_para">&ldquo;Follow me,&rdquo; said the gentleman, tapping him familiarly on
the cheek.</p>

<p class="new_para">Will needed no second invitation. Climbing one flight of
stairs, he found himself in a small studio, lined on all sides by
pictures; some finished and framed, others in various stages
of progression. Pallets, brushes, and crayons, lay scattered
round an easel; while in one corner was an artist&#8217;s lay figure,
which, in the dim light of the apartment, Will mistook for the
artist&#8217;s wife, whose presence he respectfully acknowledged by
a profound bow, to the infinite amusement of his patron.</p>

<p class="new_para">Mr. Lester was delighted with Will&#8217;s naive criticisms on his
pictures, and his profound reverence for art. A few days
found him quite domesticated in his new quarters; and
months passed by swift as a weaver&#8217;s shuttle, and found
him as happy as a crowned prince; whether grinding
colors for the artist, or watching the progress of his pencil,
or picking up stray crumbs of knowledge from the lips of
connoisseurs, who daily frequented the studio; and many a
rough sketch did Will make in his little corner, that would have
made them open their critical eyes wide with wonder.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p class="new_para">&ldquo;What a foolish match!&rdquo; Was an engagement ever announced
that did not call forth this remark, from some dissenting
lip? Perhaps it <em>was</em> a &ldquo;foolish match.&rdquo; Meta had no
dower but her beauty, and Will had no capital but his pallet
and easel. The gossips said she &ldquo;might have done much better.&rdquo;
There was old Mr. Hill, whose head was snow white,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</a></span>
but whose gold was as yellow and as plenty as Meta&#8217;s bright
ringlets; and Mr. Vesey, whose father made a clergyman of
him, because he didn&#8217;t know enough to be a merchant; and
Lawyer Givens, with his carrotty head and turn-up nose, and
chin that might have been beat; and Falstaff-ian Captain Reef,
who brought home such pretty china shawls and grass cloth
dresses, and who had as many wives as a Grand Turk. Meta
might have had any one of these by hoisting her little finger.
Foolish Meta! money and misery in one scale, poverty
and love in the other. Miserable little Meta! And yet she
does not look so <em>very</em> miserable, as she leans over her husband&#8217;s
shoulder, and sees the landscape brighten on the canvass, or
presses her rosy lips to his forehead, or arranges the fold of a
curtain for the desired light and shade, or grinds his colors with
her own dainty little fingers; no, she looks anything but miserable
with those soft eyes so full of light, and that elastic step,
and voice of music, that are inspiration to her artist husband.
No; she thinks the &ldquo;old masters&rdquo; were fools to her young
master, and she already sees the day when his studio will be
crowded with connoisseurs and patrons, and his pictures bring
him both fame and fortune; and then, they will travel in foreign
countries, and sleep under Italia&#8217;s soft blue skies, and see
the Swiss glaciers, and the rose-wreathed homes of England,
and the grim old chateaux of France, and perhaps beard old
Haynau in his den. Who knows? Yes; and Will should feast
his eyes on beauty, and they&#8217;d be as happy, as if care and sorrow
had never dimmed a bright eye with tears, since the seraph
stood, with a flaming sword, to guard the gate of Eden.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</a></span>
Hopeful, happy, trusting Meta! the bird&#8217;s carol is not sweeter
than yours;&mdash;and yet the archer takes his aim, and with broken
wing it flutters to the ground.</p>

<p class="new_para">Yes: Meta was an angel. Will said it a thousand times a
day, and his eyes repeated it when his tongue was silent.
Meta&#8217;s brow, and cheek, and lips, and tresses were multiplied
indefinitely, in all his female heads. Her dimpled hand,
her round arm, her plump shoulder, her slender foot, all served
him for faultless models.</p>

<p class="new_para">Life was so beautiful to him now! his employment so congenial,
his heart so satisfied. It <em>must be</em> that he should succeed.
The very thought of failure&mdash;&ldquo;but then, he <em>should not</em> fail!&rdquo;
Poor Will! he had yet to learn that garrets are as often the
graves as the nurseries of genius, and that native talent goes
unrecognized until stamped with <em>foreign</em> approbation. Happily&mdash;hopefully&mdash;heroically
he toiled on; morning&#8217;s earliest
beam, and day&#8217;s last lingering ray finding him busy at his
easel. But, alas! as time passed, though patrons came not,
creditors did; and one year after their marriage, Meta might
have been seen stealthily conveying little parcels back and
forth to a small shop in the neighborhood, where employment
was furnished for needy fingers. It required all her feminine
tact and diplomacy to conceal from Will her little secret, or to
hide the tell-tale blush, when he noticed the disappearance of
her wedding ring, which now lay glittering in a neighboring
pawn-broker&#8217;s window; yet never for an instant, since the little
wife first slept on Will&#8217;s heart, had she one misgiving that she
had placed her happiness unalterably in his keeping.</p>

<p class="new_para"><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</a></span></p>

<p class="new_para">Oh, inscrutable womanhood! Pitiful as the heart of God,
when the dark cloud of misfortune, or shame, bows the strong
frame of manhood; merciless&mdash;vindictive&mdash;implacable as the
Prince of Darkness, towards thy tempted, forsaken and sorrowing
sisters!</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p class="new_para">The quick eye of affection was not long in discovering Meta&#8217;s
secret; and now every glance of love, every caress, every endearing
tone of Meta&#8217;s, gave Will&#8217;s heart a sorrow pang.</p>

<p class="new_para">Meta! who had turned a deaf ear to richer lovers, to share
<em>his</em> heart and home; Meta! whose beauty might grace a court,
whose life should be all sunshine: that Meta&#8217;s bright eyes
should dim, her cheek pale, her step grow prematurely slow
and faltering, for him!&mdash;the thought was torture.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p class="new_para">&ldquo;To-morrow, Will&mdash;you said to-morrow,&rdquo; said Meta, hiding
her tears on her husband&#8217;s shoulder; &ldquo;the land of <em>gold</em> is also
the land of <em>graves</em>,&rdquo; and she gazed mournfully into his face.</p>

<p class="new_para">&ldquo;Dear Meta,&rdquo; said her husband, &ldquo;do not unman me with
your tears; our parting will be brief, and I shall return to you
with gold&mdash;gold! Meta; and you shall yet have a home
worthy of you. Bear up, dear Meta&mdash;the sun will surely
break through the cloud rift. God bless and keep my darling
wife.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="new_para">Poor little Meta! for hours she sat stupefied with sorrow,
in the same spot where Will had left her. The sun shone<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</a></span>
cheerfully in at the little window of her new home, but its
beams brought no warmth to Meta&#8217;s heart. The clinging
clasp of Will&#8217;s arms was still about her neck: Will&#8217;s kiss was
still warm upon her lips, and yet&mdash;<em>she was alone</em>.</p>

<p class="new_para">She thought, with a shudder, of the treacherous sea; of the
pestilence that walketh in darkness; of a sick-bed, on a foreign
shore; of the added bitterness of the death pang, when the
eye looks vainly for the <em>one loved face</em>; and bowing her face
in her hands, she wept convulsively.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p class="new_para">&ldquo;Dear heart! Goodness alive!&rdquo; said Meta&#8217;s landlady, peeping
in at the door. &ldquo;Don&#8217;t take on so; bless me, how long
have you been married? you&#8217;re nothing better than a child
<em>now</em>. Why didn&#8217;t you go to Californy with your husband?
Where&#8217;s your folks?&mdash;whose picter is that? Ah! I see now,
it is meant for you. But why didn&#8217;t you have on a gown, dear,
instead of being wrapped up in them clouds? It makes you
look like a sperit. Come now, don&#8217;t sit moping here; come
down stairs and see me work; it will amuse you like. I&#8217;m
going to make some brown bread. I dare say you never made
a bit of brown bread in your life. I put a power of Ingin in
mine. I learned that in the country. I was brought up in the
country. I hate city folks; they&#8217;ve no more heart than a sexton;
much as ever they can stop frolicking long enough to bury
one another. They&#8217;ll sleep, too, like so many tops, while the
very next street is all of a blaze, and their poor destitute fellow-creatures
are turned naked into the streets. They&#8217;ll plow<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</a></span>
right through a burying ground, if they take a notion, harrowing
up dead folks, and <em>live</em> ones, too, <em>I</em> guess. And as to Sunday&mdash;what
with Jews, and Frenchmen, and down Easters, and
other foreigners, smoking and driving through the streets, &#8217;tisn&#8217;t
any Sunday at all. Well, I never knew what Sodom meant till
I came to the city. Why Lot&#8217;s wife turned round to take a
second look at it, is beyond me. Well, if you won&#8217;t come
down stairs I must leave you, for I smell my bread burning;
but do cheer up&mdash;you look as lonesome as a pigeon on a spout
of a rainy day.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="new_para">A letter from the best beloved! How our eye lingers on
the well-known characters. How we torture the words to extract
hidden meanings. How tenderly we place it near the heart,
and under the pillow. How lingeringly comes the daylight,
when our waiting eyes would re-peruse what is already indelibly
written on the heart!</p>

<p class="new_para">Will&#8217;s voyage had been prosperous&mdash;his health was good&mdash;his
hope and courage unabated. Meta&#8217;s eye sparkled, and her
cheek flushed like a rose, as she pressed the letter again and
again to her lips; but, after all, it was <em>only</em> a letter, and time
dragged <em>so</em> heavily. Meta was weary of sewing, weary of reading,
weary of watching endless pedestrians pass and repass beneath
her window, and when <em>twilight</em> came, with its deepening
shadows&mdash;that hour so sweet to the happy, so fraught with
gloom to the wretched&mdash;and Meta&#8217;s eye fell upon the little
house opposite, and saw the little parlor lamp gleam like a
beacon light for the absent husband, while the happy wife
glided about with busy hands, and lightsome step, and when, at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</a></span>
last, <em>he</em> came, and the broken circle was complete, poor Meta
turned away to weep.</p>

<p class="new_para">Joy, Meta, joy! dry your tears! Will has been successful.
Will is coming home. Even now the Sea-Gull plows
the waves, with its precious living freight. Lucky Will!
he <em>has</em> &ldquo;found gold,&rdquo; but it was dug from &ldquo;the mine&rdquo; of the
artist&#8217;s brain. Magical Will! the liquid eyes and graceful
limbs of Senor Alvarez&#8217;s only daughter are reproduced on
canvas, in all their glowing beauty, by your magic touch!
The Senor is rich&mdash;the Senor is liberal&mdash;the Senor&#8217;s taste
is as unimpeachable as his credit&mdash;the Senor has pronounced
Will &ldquo;a genius.&rdquo; Other Senors hear it; other Senors have
gold in plenty, and dark-eyed, graceful daughters, whose charms
Will perpetuates, and yet <em>fails to see</em>, for <em>a sweeter face which
comes between</em>.</p>

<p class="new_para">Dry your tears, little Meta&mdash;smooth the neglected ringlets&mdash;don
<em>his</em> favorite robe, and listen with a flushed cheek, a beating
heart and a love-lit eye, for the long absent but well remembered
footstep.</p>

<p class="new_para">Ah! Meta, there <em>are</em> meetings that o&#8217;erpay the pain of parting.
But, dear Reader, you and I are <em><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">de trop</span></em>.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p class="new_para">You should have seen how like a little brigand Will looked,
with his bronzed face and fierce beard and mustache&mdash;so
fierce that Meta was half afraid to jump into his arms; you
should have seen Meta&#8217;s new home to know what a pretty
little nest love and taste may weave for a cherished bird; you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</a></span>
should have seen with what a Midas touch Will&#8217;s gold suddenly
opened the eyes of people to his wonderful merit, as an artist;
how &ldquo;patrons&rdquo; flocked in, now that he lived in a handsome
house in Belgrave Square; how Mr. Jack Punch repented with
crocodile tears, that he had ever kicked him out of &ldquo;the Chronicle
office,&rdquo; and how Will immortalized him on canvas, in the
very act; not forgetting to give due prominence, in the foreground,
to the figure of his philanthropic employer, Mr. John
Howard, who, in the touching language of his Prospectus,
always made it a point to &ldquo;exalt virtue, however humble!&rdquo;</p>

<h2>TABITHA TOMPKINS&#8217; SOLILOQUY.</h2>
<p class="new_para">Have I, Tabitha Tompkins, a right to my share of fresh air
uncontaminated? or have I not? I ask the question with my
arms akimbo. I might as well say what I&#8217;ve got to say, popgun
fashion, as to tiptoe round my subject, mincing and curtesying
when I&#8217;m all ablaze with indignation.</p>

<p class="new_para">I ask again: Have I a right to my share of fresh air uncontaminated?
or have I not?</p>

<p class="new_para">Do I go out for a walk? Every man I meet is a locomotive

till I&#8217;m black in the face. I, Tabitha Tompkins, whose grandfather

I feel seventy-six-y! I have borne it about as long as
I can without damage to hooks and eyes.</p>

<p class="new_para">If I try to escape it, by getting into an omnibus, there it is
again! If it does not originate inside, some &ldquo;gentleman&rdquo; on

a ferry boat, I find &ldquo;gentlemen requested not to smoke,&rdquo; (as
usual) a dead letter,&mdash;no more regarded than is the law against
gaming, or the Sunday liquor traffic. Do I go to a concert at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</a></span>
Castle Garden, and step out on the balcony between the performances
for a breath of fresh air?&mdash;myriads of lighted Havannas
send me dizzy and staggering back into the concert
room. Does a gentleman call to see me of an evening?&mdash;the
instant he shakes his &ldquo;ambrosial curls,&rdquo; and gives &ldquo;a nod,&rdquo; I
have to run for my vinaigrette.</p>

<p class="new_para">Do I advertise for lodgings; and after much inspection of
rooms, and wear and tear of patience and gaiter boots, make a
final selection? Do I emigrate with big trunk, and little trunk,

and work-table, and writing-desk, and pretty little lamp, all
safely transported and longitudinized to my fancy? Do I, in a
paradisaical state of mind, (attendant upon said successful emigration,)
go to my closet, some fine morning, and take down a
pet dress?&mdash;asaf&#339;tida and onions, what an odor! All the
&ldquo;pachouli&rdquo; and &ldquo;new mown hay&rdquo; in New York wouldn&#8217;t
sweeten it. Six young men the other side of that closet, and
all smokers!!! Betty, you may have that dress;&mdash;I wouldn&#8217;t
touch it with a pair of tongs.</p>

<p class="new_para">Do I lend a masculine friend my copy of Alexander Smith&#8217;s

quarantine? Does he, by mistake, carry home my tippet in
his pocket after a concert?&mdash;can I compute the hours it must
hang dangling on the clothes line, before it can be allowed to
resume its place round my neck?</p>

<p class="new_para">Do I go to church on Sunday, with a devout desire to attend

and groans; crosses his feet and uncrosses them; kicks over
the cricket; knocks down his cane; drops the hymn-book, and
finally draws from his coat pocket a little case; takes out one
segar after another, transposes them, applies them to the end
of his nose, and pats them affectionately; then he examines his
watch; then frowns at the pulpit; then, glancing at the door,
draws a sigh long enough and strong enough to inflate a pair
of bellows, or burst off a vest button.</p>

<h2>SOLILOQUY OF A HOUSEMAID.</h2>

<p class="new_para">Oh, dear, dear! Wonder if my mistress <em>ever</em> thinks I am
made of flesh and blood? Five times, within half an hour, I
have trotted up stairs, to hand her things, that were only four
feet from her rocking-chair. Then, there&#8217;s her son, Mr.
George,&mdash;it does seem to me, that a great able-bodied man
like him, needn&#8217;t call a poor tired woman up four pair of stairs
to ask &ldquo;what&#8217;s the time of day?&rdquo; Heigho!&mdash;its &ldquo;<em>Sally</em> do
this,&rdquo; and &ldquo;<em>Sally</em> do that,&rdquo; till I wish I never had been baptized
at all; and I might as well go farther back, while I am about
it, and wish I had never been born.</p>

<p class="new_para">Now, instead of ordering me round so like a dray horse, if
they would only look up smiling-like, now and then; or ask me
how my &ldquo;rheumatiz&rdquo; did; or say good morning, Sally; or show
some sort of interest in a fellow-cretur, I could pluck up a bit of
heart to work for them. A kind word would ease the wheels
of my treadmill amazingly, and wouldn&#8217;t cost <em>them</em> anything,
either.</p>

<p class="new_para">Look at my clothes, all at sixes and sevens. I can&#8217;t get a
minute to sew on a string or button, except at night; and then
I&#8217;m so sleepy it is as much as ever I can find the way to bed;
and what a bed it is, to be sure! Why, even the pigs are now<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</a></span>
and then allowed clean straw to sleep on; and as to bed-clothes,
the less said about them the better; my old cloak serves for a
blanket, and the sheets are as thin as a charity school soup.
Well, well; one wouldn&#8217;t think it, to see all the fine glittering
things down in the drawing-room. Master&#8217;s span of horses,
and Miss Clara&#8217;s diamond ear-rings, and mistresses rich dresses.
I <em>try</em> to think it is all right, but it is no use.</p>

<p class="new_para">To-morrow is Sunday&mdash;&ldquo;day of <em>rest</em>&rdquo; I believe they <em>call</em> it.
<span class="spaced"> Humph!</span>&mdash;more cooking to be done&mdash;more company&mdash;more
confusion than on any other day in the week. If I own
a soul I have not heard how to take care of it for many a long
day. Wonder if my master and mistress calculate to pay me
for <em>that</em>, if I lose it? It is a <em>question</em> in my mind. Land of

<h2>CRITICS.</h2>

&ldquo;Bilious wretches, who abuse you because you write better than they.&rdquo;<br />
</p>

<p class="new_para">Slander and detraction! Even I, Fanny, know better than
that. <em>I</em> never knew an editor to nib his pen with a knife as
sharp as his temper, and write a scathing criticism on a book,
because the authoress had declined contributing to his paper. I
never knew a man who had fitted himself to a promiscuous
coat, cut out in merry mood by taper fingers, to seize his porcupine
quill, under the agony of too tight a <em>self-inflicted</em> fit, to
annihilate the offender. I never saw the bottled-up hatred of
years, concentrated in a single venomous paragraph. I never
heard of an unsuccessful masculine author, whose books were
drugs in the literary market, speak with a sneer of successful
literary feminity, and insinuate that it was by <em>accident</em>, not <em>genius</em>,
that they hit the popular favor!</p>

<p class="new_para">By the memory of &ldquo;seventy-six,&rdquo; No! Do you suppose
a <em>man&#8217;s</em> opinions are in the market&mdash;to be bought and sold
to the highest bidder? Do you suppose he would laud a vapid
book, because the fashionable authoress once laved his toadying
temples with the baptism of upper-tendom? or, do you suppose
he&#8217;d lash a poor, but self-reliant wretch, who had presumed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</a></span>
to climb to the topmost round of Fame&#8217;s ladder, without <em>his</em>
royal permission or assistance, and in despite of his repeated
attempts to discourage her? No&mdash;no&mdash;bless your simple

<h2>FORGETFUL HUSBANDS.</h2>

<p class="quote">&ldquo;There is a man out west, so forgetful, that his wife has to put a wafer on the end
of her nose, that he may distinguish her from the other ladies; but this does not
prevent him from making occasional mistakes.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="new_para">Take the wafer off your nose, my dear, and put it on your
lips! Keep silence and let Mr. Johnson go on &ldquo;making his
mistakes;&rdquo;&mdash;you cannot stop him, if you try; and if he has
made up his mind to be near-sighted, all the guide-boards
that you can set up, will only drive him home the longest way
round!</p>

<p class="new_para">So trot your babies, smooth your ringlets, digest your dinner,
and&mdash;agree to differ! Don&#8217;t call Mr. Johnson &ldquo;my dear,&rdquo;
or he will have good reason to think you are going to quarrel
with him! Look as pretty as a poppet; put on the dress he
used to like&mdash;and help him to his favorite bit at table, with
your accustomed grace; taking care not (?) to touch him, <em>accidentally</em>,
with your little fat hand, when you are passing it.
Ten to one he is on the marrow bones of his soul to you,
in less than a week, though tortures couldn&#8217;t wring a confession
out of him. Then, if he&#8217;s worth the trouble, you are to take
advantage of his silent penitence, and go every step of the
way to meet him, for he will not approximate to <em>you</em>, the
width of a straw! If he has not frittered away all your<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</a></span>
love for him, this is easily done, my dear, and for one whole
day after it, he will feel grateful to you for sparing him the
humiliation (?) of making an acknowledgment. How many
times, my dear &ldquo;Barkis,&rdquo; you will be &ldquo;willing&rdquo; to go through
all this, depends upon several little circumstances in your
history with which I am unacquainted.</p>

five minutes at a time. Isn&#8217;t it extraordinary, Mr. Stubbs?&rdquo;</p>

reading aloud the following paragraph:</p>

<p class="new_para">&ldquo;We yesterday had the gratification of visiting the celebrated
establishment of the far-famed Inman &amp; Co., Hatters, No. 172
Wideway. We pronounce their new style of spring hat, for
lightness, beauty, and durability, to be unrivaled; it is aptly
designated the &lsquo;Count D&#8217;Orsay hat.&rsquo; The gentlemanly and enterprising
proprietors of the establishment, are unwearied in
their endeavors to please the public. There is a <em><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">je ne sais

another.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="new_para">&ldquo;Every one should visit the extensive ware-rooms of Willcut
&amp; Co., Tailors, 59 Prince Albert street. There is science
wagging in the very tails of Mr. Willcut&#8217;s coats; in fact, he may
be said to be the only tailor in the city, who is a thorough <em>artist</em>.
His pantaloons are the <em>knee</em>-plus-ultra of shear-dom. Mr.
Willcut has evidently made the anatomy of masculinity a
study&mdash;hence the admirable result. The most casual observer,
on noticing Mr. Willcut&#8217;s fine phrenological developments,
would at once negative the possibility of his making a <em><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">faux

<p class="new_para">&ldquo;Keep quiet, Mrs. Stubbs; listen:&rdquo;</p>

<p class="new_para">&ldquo;The St. Lucifer Hotel is a palatial wonder; whether we
consider the number of acres it covers, the splendor of its marble
exterior, the sumptuousness of its drawing rooms, or the
more than Oriental luxuriousness of its sleeping apartments, the
tapestry, mirrors and gilding of which remind one forcibly of
the far-famed Tuileries. The host of the St. Lucifer is an
Apollo in person, a Chesterfield in manners, and a Lucullus
in <em>taste</em>; while those white-armed Houris, the female waiters, lap
the soul in Elysium.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="new_para">Mr. Stubbs lifted his spectacles to his forehead, crossed his
legs, and nodded knowingly to Mrs. Stubbs.</p>

<p class="new_para">&ldquo;That&#8217;s the way it&#8217;s done, Mrs. Stubbs. That last notice

cigars, and other little editorial perquisites. Do you want to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</a></span>
know,&rdquo; said Stubbs, (resuming the paper,) &ldquo;how he gets his carriages
repaired and his horses shod for nothing in the village
where his country seat is located? This, now, is a regular stroke
of genius. He does it by two words. In an account of his
visit to the Sybil&#8217;s Cave, in which he says, &lsquo;<span class="smallcaps">My Friend</span>, the
blacksmith, and I soon found the spot,&rsquo; &amp;c., (bah!) Then here
is something that will interest you, my dear, on the other page
of the Gazette. Mr. Simpkins has used up the dictionary in a
half-column announcement of Miss Taffety (the milliner&#8217;s) &lsquo;magnificent
opening at &mdash;&mdash; street.&rsquo; (Of course she made his wife
a present of a new Paris bonnet.&rdquo;)</p>

<p class="new_para">&ldquo;Well, I never&mdash;&rdquo; said the simple Mrs. Stubbs. &ldquo;Goodness

an editor myself. Stubbs, why don&#8217;t <em>you</em> set up a newspaper?&rdquo;</p>

<p class="new_para">&ldquo;<span class="spaced">Mrs. Stubbs!</span>&rdquo; said her husband, in an oracular tone,
&ldquo;to conduct a newspaper requires a degree of tact, enterprise
and ability to which Jotham Stubbs unfortunately is a stranger.
The Family Gazette or its founder is by no means a fair sample
of our honorable newspapers, and their upright, intelligent, and
respected editors. Great Cæsar!&mdash;no!&rdquo; said Stubbs, rising
from his chair, and bringing his hand down emphatically on his
corduroys, &ldquo;no more than you are a fair sample of feminine
beauty, Mrs. Stubbs!&rdquo;</p>

How sombre, and gloomy, and cheerless, it looks there! Your
little office-boy looks more like an imp of darkness than anything
else, as he sits crouched in the corner, with his elbows on
his knees and his chin in his hands.</p>

<p class="new_para">You button your overcoat tight to your chin, (cut possible
clients,) and run over to see your cousin Kitty. Ah! that
is worth while! A bright, blazing fire; sofa wheeled up to it,
and Kitty sitting there, looking so charming in her pretty <em><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">neglige</span></em>.
She looks up sweetly and tranquilly, and says: &ldquo;Now
that&#8217;s a good Harry; sit down by me, and be agreeable.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="new_para">Well, you &ldquo;sit down,&rdquo; (just as close as you like, too!) tell
her all the down-town male gossip; consult her confidentially
about trimming your whiskers; and desire her candid, unbiased
opinion about the propriety and feasibility, with the help
of some Macassar, of <em>coaxing out</em> a moustache! Then you
make a foray into her work-basket, tangling spools most unmercifully,
and reading over all the choice bits of poetry that
women are so fond of clipping from the newspapers. Then
you both go into the china closet, and she gets you a tempting
little luncheon; and you grow suddenly merry, and have a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</a></span>
contest which shall make the worst pun; you earn for yourself
a boxed ear, and are obliged, in self-defence, to imprison the
offending hand; your aunt comes in; let her come! are not
you and Kitty cousins?</p>

<p class="new_para">There&#8217;s a ring at the door, and Mr. Frank &mdash;&mdash; is announced.
You say, &ldquo;Unmitigated puppy!&rdquo; and begin a vehement
discussion with your aunt, about anything that comes
handy; but that don&#8217;t prevent you from seeing and hearing all
that goes on at the other side of the room. Your aunt is very
oblivious, and wouldn&#8217;t mind it if you occasionally lost the
thread of your discourse. Kitty is the least bit of a coquette!
and her conversation is very provocative, racy and sparkling;
you privately determine to read her a lecture upon it, as
soon as practicable.</p>

<p class="new_para">It seems as though Mr. Frank &mdash;&mdash; never would go. Upon
his exit, Kitty informs you that she is going to Madame &mdash;&mdash;&#8217;s
concert with him. You look serious, and tell her you
&ldquo;should be very sorry to see a cousin of yours enter a concert
room with such a brainless fop.&rdquo; Kitty tosses her curls,
pats you on the arm, and says, &ldquo;<em>Jealous</em>, hey?&rdquo; You turn on
your heel, and, lighting a cigar, bid her &ldquo;good-morning,&rdquo; and
for a little eternity of a week you never go near her. Meantime,
your gentlemen friends tell you how &ldquo;divine&rdquo; your
little cousin looked at the concert.</p>

<p class="new_para">You are in a very bad humor; cigars are no sedative&mdash;newspapers
either. You crowd your beaver down over your eyes
and start for your office. On the way you meet Kitty! Hebe!
how bright and fresh she looks! and what an unmitigated brute<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</a></span>
you&#8217;ve been to treat her so! Take care! she knows what
you are thinking about! Women are omniscient in such matters!
So she peeps archly from beneath those long eyelashes,
and says, extending the tip of her little gloved hand&mdash;&ldquo;Want
to make up, Harry?&rdquo;</p>

<p class="new_para">There&#8217;s no resisting! That smile leads you, like a will-o&#8217;-the-wisp,
anywhere! So you wait upon her home; nobody
comes in, not even your respected aunt; and you never call
her &ldquo;cousin,&rdquo; after that day; but no man living ever won such
a darling little wife, as Kitty has promised to be to you, some
bright morning.</p>

<p class="new_para">Christopher Columbus! how the frost curtains the windows:
how dirge-like the wind moans: how like a great, white pall
the snow covers the ground. Five times I&#8217;ve rung that bell
for coal, for this rickety old grate, but I might as well thump
for admittance at the gate of Paradise.</p>

<p class="new_para">And speaking of Paradise&mdash;Sam Smith, you must be married:
you haven&#8217;t a button to your shirt, nor a shirt to your
buttons either.</p>

<p class="new_para">Wonder if women are such obstinate little monkeys to manage?
Wonder if they must be bribed with a new bonnet
every day, to keep the peace? Wonder if you bring home a

out, but by experience. Well, Sam, you are a Napoleonic

woman: they are the most affectionate. She must not be too
tall: a man&#8217;s wife shouldn&#8217;t <em>look down</em> upon him. She must
not know too much: the Furies take your pert, catamount-y,
scribbling women, with a repartee always rolled up under
their tongues. She mustn&#8217;t be over seventeen: but how to
find that out, Sam, is the question: it is about as easy as to
make an editor tell you the truth about his subscription list.
She must be handsome&mdash;no she mustn&#8217;t either. I should be
as jealous as Blue Beard. All the corkscrew, pantalooned, perfumed
popinjays would be ogling her. But then, again, there&#8217;s
three hundred and sixty-five days in a year, and three times a

And how provokingly happy Tom looked, when he whirled off<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</a></span>
with her in the carriage to their new home; and what a pretty
little home it was, to be sure. It is just a year to-day since
they were married. I dined there yesterday. It strikes me
that Tom don&#8217;t joke as much as he used in his bachelor days;
and then he has a way, too, of leaving his sentences unfinished.
And I noticed that his wife often touched his foot with her
slipper under the table. What do you suppose she did that
for? Just as I was buttoning up my coat to come away, I
asked Tom if he would go to up Tammany Hall with me.
He looked at his wife, and she said, &ldquo;Oh&mdash;<em>go</em> by all means,
Mr. Hillot;&rdquo; when Tom immediately declined. I don&#8217;t understand

is enough to make bachelor eyes turn green to see them.
Mrs. Jones had been four times a widow, when she married
John. She knows the value of husbands. She takes precious
good care of John. Before he goes to the office in the morning,
she pops her head out the window to see if the weathercock
indicates a surtout, spencer, cloak, or Tom and Jerry; this
point settled, she follows him to the door, and calls him back
to close his thorax button &ldquo;for fear of quinsy.&rdquo; Does a shower
come up in the forenoon? She sends him clogs, India-rubbers,
an extra flannel shirt, and an oilcloth overall, and prepares two
quarts of boiling ginger tea to administer on his arrival, to prevent
the damp from &ldquo;striking in.&rdquo; If he helps himself to a second
bit of turkey, she immediately removes it from his plate, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</a></span>
applying a pocket handkerchief to her eyes, asks him &ldquo;if he
has the heart to make her for the fifth time a widow?&rdquo; You

Pardiggle this very night. &ldquo;Pardiggle!&rdquo; Ph&#339;bus! what a

want a wife: there&#8217;s one point already in which we
perfectly agree. I hate preliminaries. I suppose it is unnecessary
for me to begin with the amatory alphabet. With a

<h2>LOVE AND DUTY.</h2>
<p class="new_para">The moon looked down upon no fairer sight than Effie May,
as she lay sleeping on her little couch, that fair summer night.
So thought her mother, as she glided gently in, to give her a
silent, good-night blessing. The bright flush of youth, and
hope was on her cheek. Her long dark hair lay in masses
about her neck and shoulders; a smile played upon the
red lips, and the mother bent low to catch the indistinct
murmur. She starts, at the whispered name, as if a serpent
had stung her; and as the little snowy hand is tossed restlessly
upon the coverlid, she sees, glittering in the moonbeams, on
that childish finger, the golden signet of betrothal. Sleep
sought in vain to woo the eyes of the mother that night. Reproachfully
she asked herself, &ldquo;How could I have been so
blind? (but then Effie has seemed to me only a child!) But
he! oh, no; the <em>wine-cup</em> will be my child&#8217;s rival; it must not
be.&rdquo; Effie was wilful, and Mrs. May knew she must be cautiously
dealt with; but she knew, also, that no mother need
despair, who possesses the affection of her child.</p>

<p class="new_para">Effie&#8217;s violet eyes opened to greet the first ray of the morning
sun, as he peeped into her room. She stood at the little
mirror, gathering up, with those small hands, the rich tresses<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</a></span>
so impatient of confinement. How could she fail to know that
she was fair?&mdash;she read it in every face she met; but there
was <em>one</em> (and she was hastening to meet him) whose eye had
noted, with a lover&#8217;s pride, every shining ringlet, and azure vein,
and flitting blush; his words were soft and low, and skillfully
chosen, and sweeter than music to her ear; and so she tied,
with a careless grace, the little straw hat under her dimpled
chin; and fresh, and sweet, and guileless, as the daisy that bent
beneath her foot, she tripped lightly on to the old trysting place
by the willows.</p>

<p class="new_para">Stay! a hand is laid lightly upon her arm, and the pleading
voice of a mother arrests that springing step.</p>

<p class="new_para">&ldquo;Effie dear, sit down with me on this old garden seat; give
up your walk for this morning; I slept but indifferently last
night, and morning finds me languid and depressed.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="new_para">A shadow passed over Effie&#8217;s face; the little cherry lips pouted,
and a rebellious feeling was busy at her heart; but one look in
her mother&#8217;s pale face decided her, and, untying the strings of
her hat, she leaned her head caressingly upon her mother&#8217;s
shoulder.</p>

<p class="new_para">&ldquo;You are ill, dear mother; you are <em>troubled</em>;&rdquo; and she
looked inquiringly up into her face.</p>

<p class="new_para">&ldquo;Listen to me, Effie, I have a story to tell you of myself:
When I was about your age, I formed an acquaintance with a
young man, by the name of Adolph. He had been but a short time
in the village, but long enough to win the hearts of half the
young girls, from their rustic admirers. Handsome, frank and
social, he found himself everywhere a favorite. He would sit<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</a></span>
by me for hours, reading our favorite authors; and side by
side, we rambled through all the lovely paths with which our village
abounded. My parents knew nothing to his disadvantage,
and were equally charmed as myself with his cultivated refinement
of manner, and the indefinable interest with which he
invested every topic, grave or gay, which it suited his mood to
discuss. Before I knew it, my heart was no longer in my own
keeping. One afternoon, he called to accompany me upon a
little excursion, we had planned together. As he came up the
gravel walk, I noticed that his fine hair was in disorder: a
pang, keen as death, shot through my heart, when he approached
me, with reeling, unsteady step, and stammering tongue. I
could not speak. The chill of death gathered round my heart.
I fainted. When I recovered, he was gone, and my mother&#8217;s
face was bending over me, moist with tears. Her woman&#8217;s
heart knew all that was passing in mine. She pressed her lips
to my forehead, and only said, &lsquo;God strengthen you to choose
the right, my child.&rsquo;</p>

<p class="new_para">&ldquo;I could not look upon her sorrowful eyes, or the pleading
face of my gray-haired father, and trust myself again to the
witchery of that voice and smile. A letter came to me; I
dared not read it. (Alas! my heart pleaded too eloquently,
even then, for his return.) I returned it unopened; my father
and mother devoted themselves to lighten the load that lay
upon my heart; but the perfume of a flower, a remembered
strain of music, a struggling moonbeam, would bring back old
memories, with a crushing bitterness that swept all before it for
the moment. But my father&#8217;s aged hand lingered on my head<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</a></span>
with a blessing, and my mother&#8217;s voice had the sweetness of
an angel&#8217;s, as it fell upon my ear!</p>

<p class="new_para">&ldquo;Time passed on, and I had conquered myself. Your father
saw me, and proposed for my hand; my parents left me free
to choose, and Effie dear, <em>are we not happy</em>?&rdquo;</p>

<p class="new_para">&ldquo;Oh, mother,&rdquo; said Effie, (then looking sorrowfully in her
face,) &ldquo;did you <em>never</em> see Adolph again?&rdquo;</p>

<p class="new_para">&ldquo;Do you remember, my child, the summer evening we sat
upon the piazza, when a dusty, travel-stained man came up the
steps, and begged for &lsquo;a supper?&rsquo; Do you recollect his bloated,
disfigured face? Effie, <em>that was Adolph</em>!&rdquo;</p>

<p class="new_para">&ldquo;Not that <em>wreck</em> of a <em>man</em>, mother?&rdquo; said Effie, (covering
her eyes with her hands, as if to shut him out from her sight.)</p>

<p class="new_para">&ldquo;Yes; that was all that remained of that glorious intellect,
and that form made after God&#8217;s own image. I looked around
upon my happy home, then upon your noble father&mdash;then&mdash;upon

<em>ring</em> that encircled it,) &ldquo;in <em>your</em> ear, my daughter, I now breathe
my mother&#8217;s prayer for me&mdash;&lsquo;<em>God help you to choose the
right!</em>&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

<p class="new_para">The bright head of Effie sank upon her mother&#8217;s breast, and
with a gush of tears she drew the golden circlet from her finger,
and placed it in her mother&#8217;s hand.</p>

<h2>A FALSE PROVERB.</h2>
<p class="new_para">I wonder who but the &ldquo;father of lies,&rdquo; originated this proverb,
&ldquo;Help yourself and then everybody else will help you.&rdquo;
Is it not as true as the book of Job that it&#8217;s just driving the
nails into your own coffin, to let anybody know you want help!
Is not a &ldquo;seedy&rdquo; hat, a threadbare coat, or patched dress, an
effectual shower-bath on old friendships? Have not people a
mortal horror of a sad face and a pitiful story? Don&#8217;t they on
hearing it, instinctively poke their purses into the farthest, most
remote corner of their pockets? Don&#8217;t they rap their warm
garments round their well-fed persons, and advise you, in a
saintly tone, &ldquo;to trust in Providence?&rdquo; Are they not always
&ldquo;engaged&rdquo; ever after, when you call to see them? Are they
not near-sighted when you meet them in the street?&mdash;and don&#8217;t
they turn short corners to get out of your way? &ldquo;Help yourself,&rdquo;&mdash;of
course you will, (if you have any spirit;)&mdash;but when
sickness comes, or dark days, and your wits and nerves are
both exhausted, don&#8217;t place any dependence on this lying proverb!&mdash;or
you will find yourself decidedly humbugged. And
then, when your heart is so soft that anybody could knock you
down with a feather, get into the darkest hole you can find, and
cry it out! Then crawl out, bathe your eyes till they shine<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</a></span>
again, and if you have one nice garment left, out with it, put it
on! turn your shawl on the brightest side; put your best and
prettiest foot foremost; tie on your go-to-meetin&#8217; bonnet, and
smile under it, if it half kills you; and see how complaisant
the world will be when&mdash;you ask nothing of it!</p>

<p class="new_para">But if (as there are exceptions to all rules,) you should chance
to stumble upon a true friend (when you can only render thanks

words of Mr. Renoux, &ldquo;in a drooping, invalid state:&rdquo; nevertheless,
she might be seen, by the initiated, haunting the back
stairs and entries, and with flying cap-strings, superintending
kitchen-cabinet affairs.</p>

<p class="new_para">Mrs. Renoux was the unhappy mother of three unmarried
daughters, with red hair, and tempers to match; who languished
over Byron, in elegant <em><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">negligées</span></em>, of a morning, till after the
last masculine had departed; then, in curl-papers and calico
long-shorts, performed, for the absentees, the duty of chambermaids;
peeping into valises, trunks, bureaus, cigar boxes and
coat pockets, and replenishing their perfumed bottles, from the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</a></span>
gentlemen&#8217;s toilet stands, with the most perfect <em>nonchalance</em>.
At dinner, they emerged from their chrysalis state, into the
most butterfly gorgeousness, and exchanged the cracked treble,
with which they had been ordering round the over-tasked
maid-of-all-work, as they affectionately addressed &ldquo;Papa.&rdquo;</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p class="new_para">At the commencement of my story, Renoux was as happy
as a kitten with its first mouse&mdash;having entrapped, with the
bait of his alluring advertisement, a widow lady with one child.
&ldquo;The comforts and elegancies of a home;&rdquo;&mdash;it was just
what the lady was seeking:&mdash;how very fortunate!</p>

<p class="new_para">&ldquo;Certainly, Madam,&rdquo; said Renoux, doubling himself into
the form of the letter C. &ldquo;I will serve your meals in your
own room, if you prefer; but, really, Madam, I trust you will
sometimes grace the drawing-room with your presence, as we
have a very select little family of boarders. Do you choose
to breakfast at eight, nine, or ten, Madam? Do you incline to
Mocha? or prefer the leaves of the Celestial city? Are you
fond of eggs, Madam? Would you prefer to dine at four, or
five? Do you wish six courses, or more? There is the bell-rope,
Madam. I trust you will use it unsparingly, should any
thing be omitted or neglected. I am just on my way down
town, and if you will favor me by saying what you would
fancy for your dinner to-day, (the market is full of every
thing&mdash;fish, flesh, fowl and game of all sorts,) you have only to
express a wish, Madam, and the thing is here; I should be miserable,
indeed, were the request of a <em>lady</em> to be disregarded in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</a></span>
<em>my</em> house, and that lady deprived of her natural protector.
Which is it, Madam, fish? flesh? or fowl? Any letters to
send to the post-office, Madam? Any commands any where?
I shall be <em>too</em> happy to be of service&rdquo;;&mdash;and bending to the
tips of his patent leather toes, Mr. Renoux, facing the lady,
bowed obsequiously and Terpsichore-ally out of the apartment.</p>

<p class="new_para">The dinner hour came. An Irish servant-girl came with it;
and drawing out a table at an Irish angle upon the floor, tossed
over it a tumbled table-cloth; placed upon it a castor, minus
one leg, some cracked salt-cellars and tumblers; then laid some
knives, left-handed, about the table; then, withdrew, to reappear
with the result of Mr. Renoux&#8217;s laborious research &ldquo;in the
market filled with every thing,&rdquo; viz: a consumptive looking
mackerel, whose skin clung tenaciously to its back bone, and
a Peter Schemel looking chicken, which, in its life-time, must
have had a vivid recollection of Noah and the forty days&#8217;
shower. This was followed by a dessert of stale baker&#8217;s tarts,
compounded of lard and dried apples; and twenty-four purple
grapes.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p class="new_para">The next morning, Mr. Renoux tip-toed in, smirking and
bowing, as if the bill of fare had been the most sumptuous in
the world, and expressed the greatest astonishment and indignation,
that &ldquo;the stupid servant had neglected bringing up the
other courses which he had provided;&rdquo; then he inquired
&ldquo;how the lady had rested;&rdquo; and when she preferred a request
for another pillow, (there being only six feathers in the one she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</a></span>
had,) he assured her that it should be in her apartment in less
than one hour. A fortnight after, he expressed the most intense
disgust, that &ldquo;the rascally upholsterer&rdquo; had not yet sent <em>what
he had never ordered</em>. Each morning, Mr. Renoux presented
himself, at a certain hour, behind a very stiff dickey, and offered
the lady the morning papers. Seating himself on the sofa,
he would remark that&mdash;it was a very fine day, and that affairs
in France appeared to be <em><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">in statu quo</span></em>; or, that the Czar
had ordered his generals to occupy the principalities; that
Gorchakoff was preparing to cross the Danube; that the Sultan
had dispatched Omar Pasha to the frontiers; that the
latter gentleman had presented his card to Gorchakoff, on
the point of a yataghan, which courtesy would probably lead
to&mdash;&mdash;something else!</p>

<p class="new_para">During one of these agreeable calls, the lady took occasion
slightly to object to Betty&#8217;s nibbling the tarts, as she brought
them up for dinner; whereupon, Mr. Renoux declared, upon
the honor of a Frenchman, that &ldquo;she should be pitched out of
the door immediately, if not sooner; and an efficient servant
engaged to take her place.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="new_para">The next day, the &ldquo;efficient servant&rdquo; came in, broom in hand,
whistling &ldquo;Oh, <span class="correction"
title="Transcriber&apos;s Note: Originally &ldquo;Susannna&rdquo;">Susanna</span>,&rdquo; and passing into the little dressing-room,
to &ldquo;put it to rights,&rdquo; amused herself by trying on the
widow&#8217;s best bonnet, and polishing her teeth and combing her
hair with that lady&#8217;s immaculate and individual head-brush and
tooth-brush. You will not be surprised to learn, that their injured
and long-suffering owner, took a frantic and &ldquo;French
leave&rdquo; the following morning, in company with her big and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[Pg 129]</a></span>
little band-boxes; taking refuge under the sheltering roof of
Madame Finfillan.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p class="new_para">Madame Finfillan was a California widow; petite, plump
and pretty&mdash;who bore her cruel bereavement with feminine
philosophy, and slid round the world&#8217;s rough angles with a most
eel-like dexterity. In short, she was a Renoux in petticoats.
Madame welcomed the widow with great pleasure, because, as
she said, she &ldquo;wished to fill her house only with first-class
boarders;&rdquo; and the widow might be assured that she had the
apartments fresh from the diplomatic hands of the Spanish
Consul, who would on no account have given them up, had not
his failing health demanded a trip to the Continent. Madame
also assured the widow, that, (although she said it herself,)
every part of her house would bear the closest inspection;
that those vulgar horrors, cooking butter, and diluted tea, were
never seen on her Epicurean table; that they breakfasted at
ten, lunched at two, dined at six, and enjoyed themselves in the
<em>interim</em>; that her daughter, Miss Clara, was perfectly well
qualified to superintend, when business called her mother away.
And that nobody knew, (wringing her little white hands,) how
<em>much</em> business she had to do, what with trotting round to those
odious markets, trading for wood and coal, and such like uninteresting
things; or what <em>would</em> become of her, had she not
some of the best friends in the world to look after her, in the
absence of Mons. Finfillan.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p class="new_para"><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</a></span></p>

<p class="new_para">&mdash;Madame then caught up the widow&#8217;s little boy, and, half
smothering him with kisses, declared that there was nothing
on earth she loved so well as children; that there were half
a dozen of them in the house, who loved her better than their
own fathers and mothers, and that their devotion to her was at
times quite touching&mdash;(and here she drew out an embroidered
pocket handkerchief, and indulged in an interesting little sniffle behind
its cambric folds.) Recovering herself, she went on to say,
that the manner in which some boarding-house keepers treated
children, was perfectly inhuman: that she had a second table
for them, to be sure, but it was loaded with delicacies, and that
she always put them up a little school lunch herself; on which
occasion there was always an amicable little quarrel among
them, as to which should receive from her the greatest number
of kisses; also, that it was her frequent practice to get up little
parties and tableaux, for their amusement. &ldquo;But here is my
daughter, Miss Clara,&rdquo; said she, introducing a fair-haired young
damsel, buttoned up in a black velvet jacket, over a flounced
skirt.</p>

<p class="new_para">&ldquo;Just sixteen yesterday,&rdquo; said Madame: &ldquo;naughty little
blossom, budding out so fast, and pushing her poor mamma
off the stage;&rdquo; (and here Madame paused for a compliment,
and looking in the opposite mirror, smoothed her jetty ringlets
complacently.) &ldquo;Yes, every morning little blossom&#8217;s mamma
looks in the glass, expecting to find a horror of a gray hair.
But what makes my little pet so pensive to-day?&mdash;thinking
of her little lover, hey? Has the naughty little thing a thought
she does not share with mamma? But, dear me!&rdquo;&mdash;and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</a></span>
Madame drew out a little dwarf watch; &ldquo;I had quite forgotten
it is the hour Mons. Guigen gives me my guitar lesson. Adieu,
dinner at six, remember;&rdquo;&mdash;and Madame tripped, coquettishly,
out of the room.</p>

<p class="new_para"><span class="correction" title="Transcriber&apos;s Note: Opening double quotation mark removed.">Yes</span>; &ldquo;dinner at six.&rdquo; Gold salt-cellars, black waiters,
and finger-bowls; satin chairs in the parlor, and pastilles burning
on the side-table; but the sheets on the beds all torn to
ribbons; the boarders allowed but one towel a week; every
bell-rope divorced from its bell; the locks all out of order on
the chamber doors; the &ldquo;dear children&#8217;s&rdquo; bill of fare at the
&ldquo;second table&rdquo;&mdash;sour bread, watery soup, and cold buckwheat
cakes;&mdash;and &ldquo;dinner at six,&rdquo; only an invention of the
enemy, to save the expense of one meal a day&mdash;the good,
cozy, old-fashioned tea.</p>

<p class="new_para">Well, the boarders were all &ldquo;trusteed&rdquo; by Madame&#8217;s
butcher, baker and milkman; Miss Clara eloped with the
widow&#8217;s diamond ring and Mons. Peneke; and Madame, who
had heard that Mons. Finfillan was &ldquo;among the things that
<em>were</em>,&rdquo; was just about running off with Mons. Guigen, when her
liege lord suddenly returned from California, with damaged
constitution and morals, a dilapidated wardrobe and empty
coffers.</p>

Mrs. Pendennis has convinced me that <em>that</em> was a mistake.
If I try to reason with her, she talks round and round in

mistake he may have made in the course of his life, and bring
that up as a reason why you can&#8217;t give him anything more substantial,

salutary discipline for those same peccadilloes! Ask him more
questions than there are in the Assembly&#8217;s Catechism, about
his private history, and when you&#8217;ve pumped him high and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</a></span>

<h2>SUNSHINE AND YOUNG MOTHERS.</h2>

<p class="quote"><span class="smallcaps">Folly.</span> For girls to expect to be happy without marriage. Every woman was
made for a mother, consequently, babies are as necessary to their &ldquo;peace of mind,&rdquo;
as health. If you wish to look at melancholy and indigestion, look at an old maid.
If you would take a peep at sunshine, look in the face of a young mother.</p>

<p class="new_para">&ldquo;Young mothers and sunshine&rdquo;! They are worn to fiddle
strings before they are twenty-five! When an old lover turns
up, he thinks he sees his grandmother, instead of the dear little
Mary who used to make him feel as if he should crawl out of
the toes of his boots! Yes! my mind is <em>quite</em> made up about
<em>matrimony</em>; it&#8217;s a <em>one-sided</em> partnership.</p>

<p class="new_para">&ldquo;Husband&rdquo; gets up in the morning, and pays his <em><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">devoirs</span></em> to
the looking-glass; curls his fine head of hair; puts on an immaculate
shirt bosom; ties an excruciating cravat; sprinkles
his handkerchief with cologne; stows away a French roll, an
egg, and a cup of coffee; gets into the omnibus, looks at the
pretty girls, and makes love between the pauses of business
during the forenoon <em>generally</em>. Wife must &ldquo;hermetically seal&rdquo;
the windows and exclude all the fresh air, (because the baby
had &ldquo;the snuffles&rdquo; in the night;) and sits gasping down to the
table more dead than alive, to finish her breakfast. Tommy
turns a cup of hot coffee down his bosom; Juliana has torn off
the strings of her school bonnet; James &ldquo;wants his geography

<h2>UNCLE BEN&#8217;S ATTACK OF SPRING FEVER, AND HOW HE GOT CURED.</h2>

<p class="new_para">&ldquo;It is not possible that you have been insane enough to go to
housekeeping in the country, for the summer? Oh, you ought
to hear my experience,&rdquo; and Uncle Ben wiped the perspiration
from his forehead, at the very thought.</p>

<p class="new_para">Yes, I tried it once, with city habits and a city wife: got
rabid with the dog days, and nothing could cure me but a nibble
of green grass. There was Susan, you know, who never
was off a brick pavement in her life, and didn&#8217;t know the difference
between a cheese and a grindstone.</p>

<p class="new_para">Well, we ripped up our carpets, and tore down our curtains,
and packed up our crockery, and nailed down our pictures, and
eat dust for a week, and then we emigrated to Daisy Ville.</p>

<p class="new_para">Could I throw up a window or fasten back a blind in that
house, without sacrificing my suspenders and waistband button?
No, sir! Were not the walls full of Red Rovers?
Didn&#8217;t the doors fly open at every wind gust? Didn&#8217;t the
roof leak like the mischief? Was not the chimney leased to a
pack of swallows? Was not the well a half a mile from the
house?</p>

<p class="new_para"><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[Pg 147]</a></span></p>

<p class="new_para">Oh, you needn&#8217;t laugh. Instead of the comfortable naps to
which I had been accustomed, I had to sleep with one eye open
all night, lest I shouldn&#8217;t get into the city in time. I had to be
shaving in the morning before a rooster in the barn-yard had
stirred a feather; swallowed my coffee and toast by steam, and
then, still masticating, made for the front door. There stood
Peter with my horse and gig,&mdash;for I detest your cars and omnibuses.
On the floor of the chaise was a huge basket in which
to bring home material for the next day&#8217;s dinner; on the seat was
a dress of my wife&#8217;s to be left &ldquo;without fail&rdquo; at Miss Sewing
Silk&#8217;s, to have the forty-seventh hook moved one-sixth of a degree
higher up on the back. Then there was a package of
shawls from Tom Fools &amp; Co., to be returned, and a pair of
shoes to carry to Lapstone, who was to select another pair for
me to bring out at night; and a demijohn to be filled with
Sherry. Well, I whipped up Bucephalus, left my sleeping
wife and babies, and started for town; cogitating over an intricate
business snarl, which bade defiance to any straightening
process. I hadn&#8217;t gone half a mile before an old maid (I hate
old maids) stopped me to know if I was going into town, and
if I was, if I wouldn&#8217;t take her in, as the omnibusses made her
sick. She said she was niece to Squire Dandelion, and &ldquo;had a
few chores to do a shopping.&rdquo; So I took her in, or rather,
she took <em>me</em> in, (but she didn&#8217;t do it but once&mdash;for I bought
a sulkey next day!) Well, it came night, and I was hungry
as a Hottentot, for I never could dine, as your married widowers
<em>pro tem</em> do, at eating-houses, where one gravy answers for
flesh, fish and fowl, and the pudding-sauce is as black as the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[Pg 148]</a></span>
cook&#8217;s complexion. So I went round on an empty stomach,
hunting up my <em>expressman parcels</em>, and wending my way to
the stable with arms and pockets running over. When I got
home, found my wife in despair, no tacks in the house to nail
down carpets, and not one to be had at the store in the village;
the cook had deserted because she couldn&#8217;t do without &ldquo;her
<em>city privileges</em>,&rdquo; (meaning Jonathan Jones, the <span class="correction" title="Transcriber&apos;s Note: Closing single quotation mark changed to double quotation mark.">&ldquo;dry dirt&rdquo;</span>
man); and the chambermaid, a buxom country girl with fire
red hair, was spinning round the crockery (a la Blitz) because
she &ldquo;couldn&#8217;t eat with the family.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="new_para">Then Charley was taken with the croup in the night, and in
my fright I put my feet into my coat sleeves, and my arms into
my pants, and put on one of my wife&#8217;s ruffles instead of a
dicky, and rode three miles in a pelting rain, for some &ldquo;goose
grease&rdquo; for his throat.</p>

<p class="new_para">Then we never found out till cherries, and strawberries, and
peaches were ripe, how many <em>friends</em> (?) we had. There was
a horse hitched at every rail in the fence, so long as there was
anything left to eat on a tree in the farm; but if my wife went
in town shopping, and called on any of them, they were &ldquo;out,
or engaged;&rdquo;&mdash;or if at home, had &ldquo;just done dinner, and were
going to ride.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="new_para">Then there was no school in the neighborhood for the children,
and they were out in the barn-yard feeding the pigs with
lump sugar, and chasing the hens off the nest to see what was
the prospect for eggs, and making little boats of their shoes,
and sailing them in the pond, and milking the cow in the middle
of the day, &amp;c.</p>

<p class="new_para"><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[Pg 149]</a></span></p>

<p class="new_para">Then if I dressed in the morning in linen coat, thin pants,
and straw hat, I&#8217;d be sure to find the wind &ldquo;dead east&rdquo; when
I got into the city; or if I put on broadcloth and fixins to
match, it would be hotter than Shadrach&#8217;s furnace, all day&mdash;while
the dense morning fog would extract the starch from my
dicky and shirt-bosom, till they looked very like a collapsed
flapjack.</p>

<p class="new_para">Then our meeting-house was a good two miles distant, and
we had to walk, or stay at home; because my factotum (Peter)
wouldn&#8217;t stay on the farm without he could have the
horse Sundays to go to Mill Village to see his affianced Nancy.
Then the old farmers leaned on my stone wall, and laughed till
the tears came into their eyes, to see &ldquo;the city gentleman&#8217;s&rdquo;
experiments in horticulture, as they passed by &ldquo;to meetin&#8217;.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="new_para">Well, sir, before summer was over, my wife and I looked as
jaded as omnibus horses&mdash;she with chance &ldquo;help&rdquo; and floods
of city company, and I with my arduous duties as <em>express man</em>
for my own family in particular, and the neighbors in general.</p>

<p class="new_para">And now here we are&mdash;&ldquo;No. 9 Kossuth square.&rdquo; Can reach
anything we want, by putting our hands out the front windows.
If, as the poet says, &ldquo;<em>man made the town</em>,&rdquo; all I&#8217;ve got to say
is&mdash;he understood his business!</p>

<h2>THE FATAL MARRIAGE.</h2>

<p class="new_para">A very pretty girl was Lucy Lee. Don&#8217;t ask me to describe
her; stars, and gems, and flowers, have long since been
exhausted in depicting heroines. Suffice it to say, Lucy was as
pretty a little fairy as ever stepped foot in a slipper or twisted
a ringlet.</p>

<p class="new_para">Of course, Lucy knew she was pretty; else why did the
gentlemen stare at her so? Why did Harry Graham send her
so many bouquets? Why did Mr. Smith and Mr. Jones try
to sit each other out in an evening call? Why were picnics
and fairs postponed, if she were engaged or ill? Why did so
many young men request an introduction? Why did all the
serenaders come beneath her window? Why was a pew or
omnibus never full when she appeared at the door? And last,
though not least, why did all the women imitate and hate
her so?</p>

<p class="new_para">We will do Miss Lucy the justice to say, that she bore her
blushing honors very meekly. She never flaunted her conquest
in the faces of less attractive feminines; no, Lucy was the
farthest remove from a coquette; but kind words and bright
smiles were as natural to her as fragrance to flowers, or music
to birds. She never <em>tried</em> to win hearts; and between you and
me, I think that&#8217;s the way she did it.</p>

<p class="new_para"><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[Pg 153]</a></span></p>

<p class="new_para">Grave discussions were often held about Lucy&#8217;s future husband;
the old maids scornfully asserting that &ldquo;beauties generally
pick up a crooked stick at last,&rdquo; while the younger ones
cared very little <em>whom</em> she married, if she only <em>were</em> married
and out of <em>their</em> way. Meanwhile, Lucy smiled at her own
happy thoughts, and sat at her little window on pleasant, summer
evenings, watching for Harry, (poor Harry,) who, when he came,
was at a loss to know if he had ever given her little heart one
flutter, so merrily did she laugh and chat with him. Skillful
little Lucy, it was very right you shouldn&#8217;t let him peep into
<em>your</em> heart till he had opened a window in <em>his own</em>.</p>

<p class="new_para">Lucy&#8217;s papa didn&#8217;t approve of late hours or lovers; moonlight
he considered but another name for rheumatism; at nine
o&#8217;clock, precisely, he rung the bell each evening for family
prayers; and when the Bible came in lovers were expected to
go out: in case they were obtuse,&mdash;chairs set back against the
wall, or an extra lamp blown out, or the fire taken apart, were
hints sufficiently broad to be understood; and they generally
answered the purpose. Miss Lucy&#8217;s little lamp, glowing immediately
after from her bed-room window, gave the <em>finale</em>
to the &ldquo;Mede and Persian&rdquo; order of Mr. Lee&#8217;s family
arrangements.</p>

<p class="new_para">Still, Lee house was not a hermitage, by any means. More
white cravats and black coats passed over &ldquo;Deacon&rdquo; Lee&#8217;s
threshold, than into any hotel in Yankeedom. Little Lucy&#8217;s
mother, too, was a modern Samaritan, never weary of experimenting
on their dyspeptic and bronchial affections; while Lucy
herself (bless her kind heart) knew full well that two-thirds of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[Pg 154]</a></span>
them had large families, empty purses, and more Judases and
Paul Prys than &ldquo;Aarons and Hurs&rdquo; in their congregations.</p>

<p class="new_para">Among the <em><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">habitués</span></em> of Lee house, none were so acceptable
to Lucy&#8217;s father, as Mr. Ezekiel Clark, a bachelor of fifty, an ex-minister,
and now an agent for some &ldquo;Benevolent Society.&rdquo;
Ezekiel had an immensely solemn face; and behind this convenient
mask he was enabled to carry out, undetected, various
little plans, ostensibly for the &ldquo;society&#8217;s&rdquo; benefit, but privately&mdash;for
his own personal aggrandizement. When Ezekiel&#8217;s opinion
was asked, he crossed his hands and feet, and fastened his
eyes upon the wall, in an attitude of the deepest abstraction,
while his questioner stood on one leg, awaiting, with the most
intense anxiety, the decision of such an oracular Solomon.
Well, not to weary you, the long and short of it was, that
Solomon was a stupid fool, who spent his time trying to
humbug the religious public in general, and Deacon Lee in particular,
into the belief that had <em>he</em> been consulted before this
world was made, he could have suggested great and manifold
improvements. As to Deacon Lee, no cat ever tossed a poor
mouse more dexterously than he played with the deacon&#8217;s free
will; all the while very demurely pocketing the spoils in the
shape of &ldquo;donations&rdquo; to the &ldquo;society,&rdquo; with which he appeased
his washerwoman and tailor, and transported himself across the
country, on trips to Newport, Saratoga, &amp;c., &amp;c.</p>

<p class="new_para">His favorite plan was yet to be carried out; which was no
more or less than a modest request for the deacon&#8217;s pretty
daughter, Lucy, in marriage. Mr. Lee rubbed his chin, and
said, &ldquo;Lucy was nothing but a foolish little girl;&rdquo; but Ezekiel<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[Pg 155]</a></span>
overruled it, by remarking that that was so much the more
reason she should have a husband some years her senior, with
some knowledge of the world, qualified to check and advise
her; to all of which, after an extra pinch of snuff, and another
look into Ezekiel&#8217;s oracular face, Deacon Lee assented.</p>

<p class="new_para">Poor little Lucy! Ezekiel knew very well that her father&#8217;s
word was law, and when Mr. Lee announced him as her future
husband, she knew she was just as much Mrs. Ezekiel Clark, as
if the bridal ring had been already slipped on her fairy finger.
She sighed heavily, to be sure, and patted her little foot nervously,
and when she handed him his tea, thought he looked
older than ever; while Ezekiel swallowed one cup after another,
till his eyes snapped and glowed like a panther&#8217;s in ambush.
That night poor Lucy pressed her lips to a faded rose,
the gift of Harry Graham; then, cried herself to sleep!</p>

<p class="new_para">Unbounded was the indignation of Lucy&#8217;s admirers, when
the sanctimonious Ezekiel was announced as the expectant
bridegroom. Harry Graham took the first steamer for Europe,
railing at &ldquo;woman&#8217;s fickleness.&rdquo; (Consistent Harry!
when never a word of love had passed his moustached lip.)</p>

<p class="new_para">Shall I tell you how Ezekiel was transformed into the most
ridiculous of lovers? how his self-conceit translated Lucy&#8217;s indifference
into maiden coyness? how he looked often in the
glass and thought he was not so <em>very</em> old after all? how he advised
Lucy to tuck away all her bright curls, because they &ldquo;looked
so childish?&rdquo; how he named to her papa an &ldquo;early marriage
day,&rdquo;&mdash;not that he felt nervous about losing his prize&mdash;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[Pg 156]</a></span>oh,
no (?)&mdash;but because &ldquo;the society&#8217;s business required his
undivided attention.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="new_para">Well; Lucy, in obedience to her father&#8217;s orders, stood up
in her snow-white robe, and vowed &ldquo;to love and cherish&rdquo; a
man just her father&#8217;s age, with whom she had not the slightest
congeniality of taste or feeling. But papa had said it was an
excellent match, and Lucy never gainsayed papa; still, her
long lashes drooped heavily over her blue eyes, and her hand
trembled, and her cheek grew deathly pale, as Ezekiel handed
her to the carriage that whirled them rapidly away.</p>

<p class="new_para">Shall I tell you how long months and years dragged wearily
on? how Lucy saw through her husband&#8217;s mask of hypocrisy
and self-conceit? how to indifference succeeded disgust? how
Harry Graham returned from Europe, with a fair young English
bride? how Lucy grew nervous and hysterical? how Ezekiel
soon wearied of his sick wife, and left her in one of those
<em>tombs</em> for the wretched, an insane hospital? and how she wasted,
day by day&mdash;then <em>died</em>, with only a hired nurse to close those
weary blue eyes?</p>

<p class="new_para">In a quiet corner of the old churchyard where Lucy sleeps, a
silver-haired old man, each night at dew-fall, paces to and fro,
with remorseless tread, as if by that weary vigil he would fain
atone to the unconscious sleeper, for turning her sweet young
life to bitterness.</p>

<h2>FRANCES SARGEANT OSGOOD.</h2>

<span class="i0">Ere June&#8217;s sweet roses blow.&rdquo;<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p class="new_para">So sang the dying poetess. The &ldquo;eternal gates&rdquo; have closed
upon her. Those dark, soul-lit eyes beam upon us no more.
&ldquo;June&rdquo; has come again, with its &ldquo;sweet roses,&rdquo; its birds, its
zephyrs, its flowers and fragrance. It is such a day as her passionate
heart would have reveled in&mdash;a day of Eden-like freshness
and beauty. I will gather some fair, sweet flowers, and
visit her grave.</p>

<p class="new_para">&ldquo;Show me Mrs. Fanny Osgood&#8217;s monument, please,&rdquo; said I
to the rough gardener, who was spading the turf in Mount
Auburn.</p>

<p class="new_para">&ldquo;In Orange Avenue, Ma&#8217;am,&rdquo; he replied, respectfully indicating,
with a wave of the hand, the path I was to pursue.</p>

<p class="new_para">Tears started to my eyes, as I trod reverently down the
quiet path. The little birds she loved so well, were skimming
confidingly and joyously along before me, and singing as
merrily as if my heart echoed back their gleeful songs.</p>

<p class="new_para">I approached the enclosure, as the gardener had directed me.
There were five graves. <em>In which</em> slept the poetess? for there
was <em>not even a headstone</em>! The flush of indignant feeling<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[Pg 158]</a></span>
mounted to my temples; the warm tears started from my eyes.
<em>She was forgotten!</em> Sweet, gifted Fanny! <em>in her own family
burial place she was forgotten!</em> The stranger from a distance,
who had worshiped her genius, might in vain make a pilgrimage
to do her honor. I, who had personally known and loved
her, had not even the poor consolation of decking the bosom
of her grave with the flowers I had gathered; I could not
kiss the turf beneath which she is reposing; I could not drop a
tear on the sod, &#8217;neath which her remains are mouldering back
to their native dust. I could not tell, (though I so longed to
know,) in which of the little graves&mdash;for there were several&mdash;slept
her &ldquo;dear May,&rdquo; her &ldquo;pure Ellen;&rdquo; the little, timid,
household doves, who folded their weary wings when the parent
bird was stricken down, by the aim of the unerring Archer.</p>

<p class="new_para">Though allied by no tie of blood to the gifted creature, who,
<em>somewhere</em>, lay sleeping there, I felt the flush of shame mount
to my temples, to turn away and leave her dust so unhonored.
Oh, God! to be so soon forgotten by all the world!&mdash;How
can even <em>earth</em> look so glad, when such a warm, passionate
heart lies cold and pulseless? Poor, gifted, forgotten Fanny!
She &ldquo;still lives&rdquo; in <em>my</em> heart; and, Reader, glance your eye
over these touching lines, &ldquo;written during her last illness,&rdquo; and
tell me, Shall she not also live in thine?</p>

<h2>BEST THINGS.</h2>
<p class="new_para">I have a horror of &ldquo;best&rdquo; things, come they in the shape of
shoes, garments, bonnets or rooms. In such a harness my
soul peers restlessly out, asking &ldquo;if I be I.&rdquo; I&#8217;m puzzled to find
myself. I become stiff and formal and artificial as my surroundings.</p>

<p class="new_para">But of all the best things, spare me the infliction of a &ldquo;best
room.&rdquo; Out upon a carpet too fine to tread upon, books too
dainty to handle, sofas that but mock your weary limbs, and
curtains that dare not face a ray of sunlight!</p>

<p class="new_para">Had I a house, there should be no &ldquo;best room&rdquo; in it. No
upholsterer should exorcise comfort, or children, from my door-sill.
The free, fresh air should be welcome to play through it;
the bright, glad sunshine to lighten and warm it; while fresh
mantel-flowers should woo us visits from humming-bird and
drowsy bee.</p>

<p class="new_para">For pictures, I&#8217;d look from out my windows, upon a landscape
painted by the Great Master&mdash;ever fresh, ever varied, and
never marred by envious &ldquo;cross lights;&rdquo; now, wreathed in
morning&#8217;s silvery mist; now, basking in noon&#8217;s broad beam;
now, flushed with sunset&#8217;s golden glow; now, sleeping in
dreamy moonlight.</p>

<p class="new_para"><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[Pg 162]</a></span></p>

<p class="new_para">For statuary, fill my house with children&mdash;rosy, dimpled,
laughing children; now, tossing their sunny ringlets from open
brows; now, vailing their merry eyes in slumberous dreams,
&#8217;neath snow-white lids; now, sweetly grave, on bended knee,
with clasped hands, and lisped words of holy prayer.</p>

<p class="new_para">Did I say I&#8217;d have nothing &ldquo;<em>best</em>?&rdquo; Pardon me. Sunday
should be the best day of all the seven&mdash;not ushered in with
ascetic form, or lengthened face, or stiff and rigid manners.
Sweetly upon the still Sabbath air should float the matin hymn
of happy childhood; blending with early song of birds, and
wafted upward, with flowers&#8217; incense, to Him whose very name
is <strong>Love</strong>. It should be no day for puzzling the half-developed
brain of childhood with gloomy creeds, to shake the simple
faith that prompts the innocent lips to say, &ldquo;Our Father.&rdquo; It
should be no day to sit upright on stiff-backed chairs, till the
golden sun should set. No; the birds should not be more
welcome to warble, the flowers to drink in the air and
sunlight, or the trees to toss their lithe limbs, free and
fetterless.</p>

<p class="new_para">&ldquo;I&#8217;m <em>so sorry</em> that to-morrow is Sunday!&rdquo; From whence
does this sad lament issue? From under <em>your</em> roof, oh mistaken
but well-meaning Christian parents&mdash;from the lips of <em>your</em>
child, whom you compel to listen to two or three unintelligible
sermons, sandwiched between Sunday schools, and finished off
at nightfall by tedious repetitions of creeds and catechisms, till
sleep releases your weary victim! No wonder your child
<em>shudders</em>, when the minister tells him that &ldquo;Heaven is one
eternal Sabbath.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="new_para">Oh, mistaken parent! relax the over-strained bow&mdash;<em>prevent

it, not a weariness, but the &ldquo;<em>best</em>&rdquo; and happiest day of all the
seven.</p>

<h2>THE VESTRY MEETING.</h2>
<p class="new_para">The clock had just struck seven. The sharp-nosed old sexton
of the Steeple-Street Church had arranged the lights to his
mind, determined the proper latitude and longitude of Bibles
and hymn-books, peeped curiously into the little black stove in
the corner, and was now admonishing every person who passed
in, of the propriety of depositing the &ldquo;free soil&rdquo; on his boots
upon the entry door-mat.</p>

<p class="new_para">In they crept, one after another&mdash;pale-faced seamstresses,
glad of a reprieve; servant girls, who had turned their backs
upon unwashed dishes; mothers, whose &ldquo;crying babies&rdquo; were
astounding the neighbors; old maids, who had nowhere to
spend their long evenings; widowers, who felt an especial solicitude
lest any of the sisters should be left to return home unprotected;
girls and boys, who came because they were bid, and
who had no very clear idea of the performances; and last,
though not least, Ma&#8217;am Spy, who thought it her duty to see
that none of the church-members were missing, and to inquire
every Tuesday night, of her friend Miss Prim, if she didn&#8217;t
consider Mrs. Violet a proper subject for church discipline, because
she always had money enough to pay her board bills,
although her husband had deserted her.</p>

<p class="new_para">Then there were the four Misses Nipper, who crawled in as if<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[Pg 165]</a></span>
the vestry floor were paved with live kittens, and who had never
been known, for four years, to vary one minute in their attendance,
or to keep awake from the first prayer to the doxology.</p>

<p class="new_para">Then, there was Mrs. John Emmons, who sang the loudest,
and prayed the longest, and wore the most expensive bonnets,
of any female member in the church&mdash;whose name was on
every committee, who instituted the <em>select praying circle</em> for
the more <em>aristocratic</em> portion of the parish, and whose pertinacious
determination to sit next to her husband at the Tuesday
night meeting, was regarded by the uninitiated as a beautiful
proof of conjugal devotion; but which, after patient investigation,
(between you and me, dear reader,) was found to be for
the purpose of arresting his coat-flaps when he popped up to
make mental shipwreck of himself by making a speech.</p>

<p class="new_para">Then, there was Mr. Nobbs, whose remarks were a re-hash
of the different religious periodicals of the day, diversified with
misapplied texts of Scripture, and delivered with an intonation
and gesticulation that would have given Demosthenes fits.</p>

<p class="new_para">Then, there was Zebedee Falstaff, who accomplished more
for the amelioration of the human race (according to his own
account) than any man of his aldermanic proportions in the
nation, and who delivered (on a hearty supper) a sleepy exhortation
on the duties of self-denial and charity, much to the
edification of one of his needy relatives, to whose tearful story
he had that very day turned a deaf ear.</p>

<p class="new_para">Then, there was Brother Higgins, who was always &ldquo;just going&rdquo;
to make a speech, &ldquo;if brother Thomas hadn&#8217;t so exactly
anticipated his sentiments a minute before.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="new_para"><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[Pg 166]</a></span></p>

<p class="new_para">Then, there was Mr. Addison Theophilus Shakspeare Milton,
full of poetical and religious inspiration, who soared so high in
the realms of fancy, that his hearers lost sight of him.</p>

<p class="new_para">Then, there was little Dr. Pillbox, who gave us every proof
in his weekly exhortations of his knowledge of &ldquo;drugs,&rdquo; not
to mention young Smith, who chased an idea round till he lost
it, and then took shelter behind a bronchial difficulty which
compelled him, &ldquo;unwillingly (?) to come to a close.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="new_para">Then, there were some sincere, good-hearted Christians&mdash;respectable
citizens&mdash;worthy heads of families; but whose lips
had never been &ldquo;touched with a live coal from off the altar.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="new_para">Where was the pastor? Oh, he was there&mdash;a slight,
fragile, scholar-like looking man, with a fine intellectual face,
exquisitely refined tastes and sensibilities, and the meek
spirit of &ldquo;the Master.&rdquo; Had those slender shoulders no cross
to bear? When chance sent some fastidious worldling through
that vestry door, did it cost him nothing to watch the smile
of contempt curl the stranger&#8217;s lip, as some uneducated, but
well-meaning layman, presented with stammering tongue, in
ungrammatical phrase, distorted, one-sided, bigoted views of
great truths which <em>his</em> eloquent tongue might have made as
clear as the noon-day, and as cheering and welcome as heaven&#8217;s
own blessed light, to the yearning, dissatisfied spirit? Oh, is
there <em>nothing</em> in religion, when it can so subdue the pride of
intellect as to enable its professor to disregard the stammering
tongue, and sit meekly at the feet of the ignorant disciple because
he <em>is</em> a disciple?</p>

<h2>A BROADWAY SHOP REVERIE.</h2>
<p class="new_para">Forty dollars for a pocket-handkerchief! My dear
woman! you need a straight-jacket, even though you may be
the fortunate owner of a dropsical purse.</p>

<p class="new_para">I won&#8217;t allude to the legitimate use of a pocket-handkerchief;
I won&#8217;t speak of the sad hearts <em>that</em> &ldquo;forty dollars,&rdquo; in the hands
of some philanthropist, might lighten; I won&#8217;t speak of the
&ldquo;crows&#8217; feet&rdquo; that will be penciled on your fair face, when your
laundress carelessly sticks the point of her remorseless smoothing
iron through the flimsy fabric, or the constant espionage you
must keep over your treasure, in omnibuses, or when promenading;
but I <em>will</em> ask you how many of the lords of creation,
for whose especial benefit you array yourself, will know whether
that cobweb rag fluttering in your hand cost forty dollars, or
forty cents?</p>

<p class="new_para">Pout if you like, and toss your head, and say that you &ldquo;don&#8217;t
dress to please the gentlemen.&rdquo; I don&#8217;t hesitate to tell you (at
this distance from your finger nails) that is a downright&mdash;&mdash;mistake!
and that the enormous sums most women expend for
articles, the cost of which few, save shop-keepers and butterfly
feminines, know, is both astounding and ridiculous.</p>

<p class="new_para">True, you have the sublime gratification of flourishing your<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[Pg 168]</a></span>
forty-dollar handkerchief of sporting your twenty-dollar &ldquo;Honiton
collar,&rdquo; or of flaunting your thousand-dollar shawl, before
the envious and admiring eyes of some weak sister, who has
made the possible possession of the article in question a profound
and lifetime study; you may pass, too, along the crowded
<em><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">pavé</span></em>, laboring under the hallucination, that every passer-by
appreciates your dry-goods value. <em>Not a bit of it!</em> Yonder
is a group of gentlemen. You pass them in your promenade;
they glance carelessly at your <em><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">tout-ensemble</span></em>, but their eyes rest
admiringly on a figure close behind you. It will chagrin you
to learn that this locomotive loadstone has on a seventy-five
cent hat, of simple straw&mdash;a dress of lawn, one shilling per
yard&mdash;a twenty-five cent collar, and a shawl of the most unpretending
price and fabric.</p>

<p class="new_para">All these items you take in at a glance, as you turn upon her
your aristocratic eye of feminine criticism to extract, if possible,
the talismanic secret of her magnetism. What is it? Let me
tell you. Nature, willful dame, has an aristocracy of her own,
and in one of her independent freaks has so daintily fashioned
your rival&#8217;s limbs, that the meanest garb could not <em>mar</em> a grace,
nor the costliest fabric <em>add</em> one. Compassionating her slender
purse, nature has also added an artistic eye, which accepts or
rejects fabrics and colors with unerring taste; hence her apparel
is always well chosen and harmonious, producing the <em>effect</em> of a
rich toilet at the cost of &ldquo;a mere song;&rdquo; and as she sweeps majestically
past, one understands why Dr. Johnson pronounced
a woman to be &ldquo;perfectly dressed when one could never remember
what she wore.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="new_para"><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[Pg 169]</a></span></p>

<p class="new_para">Now, I grant you, it is very provoking to be eclipsed by a
star <em>without a name</em>&mdash;moving out of the sphere of &ldquo;upper-ten&rdquo;-dom&mdash;a
woman who never wore a &ldquo;camel&#8217;s hair shawl,&rdquo;
or owned a diamond in her life; after the expense you have
incurred, too, and the fees you have paid to Madame Pompadour
and Stewart for the first choice of their Parisian fooleries.
It is harrowing to the sensibilities. I appreciate the awkwardness
of your position; still, my compassion jogs my invention
vainly for a remedy&mdash;unless, indeed, you consent to crush
such democratic presumption, by <em>labelling</em> the astounding price
of the dry-goods upon your aristocratic back.</p>

down upon since the morning stars first sang together; nothing

babe, whose little life hangs by a slender thread. Mortal lips
have said, &ldquo;The boy must die!&rdquo;</p>

<p class="new_para">A mother&#8217;s <em>hope</em> never dies. She clasps him closer to her
breast, and gazes upward;&mdash;food and sleep and rest are forgotten,
so that that little flickering taper die not out. Gently
upon her soft, warm breast she wooes for it baby slumbers;
long, weary nights, up and down the cottage floor she paces,
soothing its restless moaning. Suns rise and set&mdash;stars pale&mdash;seasons
come and go;&mdash;she heeds them not, so that those languid
eyes but beam brightness. Down the meadow&mdash;by the
brook&mdash;on the hill-side&mdash;she seeks with him the health-restoring
breeze.</p>

<p class="new_para">God be praised!&mdash;health comes at last! What joy to see
the rosy flush mantle on the pallid cheek!&mdash;what joy to see the

<p class="new_para">What matter though the knitting lie neglected, or the spin<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[Pg 171]</a></span>ning-wheel

What matter that the coarser fare be <em>hers</em>, so that the daintier
morsel pass <em>his</em> rosy lip? What matter that <em>her</em> robe be
threadbare, so that <em>his</em> graceful limbs be clad in Joseph&#8217;s rainbow
coat? What matter that <em>her</em> couch be hard, so that <em>his</em>
sunny head rest nightly on a downy pillow? What matter
that <em>her</em> slender purse be empty, so that <em>his</em> childish heart may
never know denial?</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p class="new_para">Years roll on. That loving mother&#8217;s eye grows dim; her
glossy locks are silvered; her limbs are sharp and shrunken;
her footsteps slow and tottering. And the boy?&mdash;the cherished
Joseph?&mdash;he of the bold, bright eye, and sinewy limb, and
bounding step? Surely, from his kind hand shall flowers be
strewn on the dim, downward path to the dark valley; surely
will her son&#8217;s strong arm be hers to lean on; his voice of music
sweeter to her dull ear than seraphs&#8217; singing.</p>

<p class="new_para">No, no!&mdash;the hum of busy life has struck upon his ear,
drowning the voice of love. He has become a <strong>man</strong>! refined,

is nearly time for your Sabbath School to commence? I hope
you have committed your hymns and commandments to memory.
Put on your little jet bracelet, and your ruffled pantalettes.
Now, say the third commandment, while I fix your
curls. It does seem to me as if your hair never curls half as
well on Sundays as on week days. Mind, you ask Letty
Brown where her mother bought that cunning little straw hat
of hers,&mdash;not in Sabbath School, of course&mdash;that would be
very wicked&mdash;but after it is over, as you walk along to
church.</p>

<p class="new_para">&ldquo;Jane, what&#8217;s the chief end of man? Don&#8217;t know? Well,
it&#8217;s the most astonishing thing that that Assembly&#8217;s Catechism

you what the chief end of man is. The chief end of man is&mdash;is&mdash;well&mdash;I&mdash;why
don&#8217;t you hold still?&mdash;you are always putting
a body out! You had better run up stairs and get your book.
Here, stop a minute, and let me tie your sash straight. Pink is

you to learn. Come; &lsquo;I believe&rsquo;&mdash;(In less than one week
your toes will be through those drab gaiters, Jane.) Goodness,
if there isn&#8217;t the bell! Why didn&#8217;t you get your lesson Saturday
evening? Oh! I recollect; you were at dancing school.
Well&mdash;you needn&#8217;t say anything about that to your teacher;
because&mdash;because there&#8217;s &lsquo;a time to dance,&rsquo; and a time to go
to meeting, and <em>now</em> it is meeting time; so, come here, and let
me roll that refractory ringlet over my finger once more, and
then, do you walk <em>solemnly</em> along to church, as a baptised child
should.</p>

<p class="new_para">&ldquo;Here! stop a bit!&mdash;you may wear this coral bracelet of
mine, if you won&#8217;t lose it. There; now you look <em>most</em> as
pretty as your mother did, when she was your age. Don&#8217;t
toss your head so, Jane; people will call you vain; and you

how a little girl <em>looks</em>, if she is only a little Christian.
There, good-bye;&mdash;repeat your catechism, going along; and

Saratoga, Newport, Niagara, White Hills, Mammoth

how crowded the cars; how incessant the cries of that poor

(see Fern Dictionary.) Now their little chattering tongues

drooping eyelid: even Alexander Smith&#8217;s new poem has slidden

mouths wide open, and their limbs twisted into all sorts of
Protean shapes. Stay; there&#8217;s one in yonder corner who is
an exception. That man knows it is becoming to him to go to
sleep. He has laid his head against the window and taken off
his hat, that the wind might lift those black curls from his broad
white brow;&mdash;he knows that his eye-lashes are long and dark,
and that his finely chiselled lips need no defect-concealing moustache;&mdash;he
knows that he can afford to turn towards us his
fine profile, with its classical outline;&mdash;he knows that his cravat
is well tied, and that the hand upon which he supports his
cheek is both well-formed and daintily white. Wonder if he
knows anything else?</p>

<p class="new_para">We halt suddenly. &ldquo;Back! back!&rdquo; says the conductor.
The sleepers start to their feet; the old maid in the corner
gives a little hysterical shriek; brakemen, conductor, and engineer
jump off, push back their hats, and gaze nervously down
the road. &ldquo;What&#8217;s the matter?&rdquo; echo scores of anxious
voices. &ldquo;What&#8217;s the matter?&rdquo; Oh, nothing; only a mother
made childless: only a little form&mdash;five minutes ago bounding
with happy life&mdash;lying a mangled corpse upon the track.
The engineer says, with an oath, that &ldquo;the child was a fool
not to get out of the way,&rdquo; and sends one of the hands back to
pick up the dismembered limbs and carry them to its mother,
who forbade even the winds of heaven to blow too roughly on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[Pg 177]</a></span>
her boy; then he gives the &ldquo;iron horse&rdquo; a fresh impetus,

which many a frantic parent will recognize; and from which

ingenuity of would-be literary lights, who pilfer one half their
original (?) ideas, and steal the remainder. I say it is to shudder

<p class="new_para">Well; they have been &ldquo;wanted&rdquo; for some time; but the
article is not in the market, although there are plenty of spurious
imitations. Time was, when a lady could decline writing
for a newspaper without subjecting herself to paragraphic attacks
from the editor, invading the sanctity of her private life.
Time was, when she could decline writing without the editor&#8217;s
revenging himself, by asserting falsely that &ldquo;he had often refused
her offered contributions?&rdquo; Time was, when if an editor
heard a vague rumor affecting a lady&#8217;s reputation, he did
not endorse it by republication, and then meanly screen himself
from responsibility by adding, &ldquo;we presume, however, that
this is only an <em><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">on dit</span></em>!&rdquo; Time was, when a lady could be a successful
authoress, without being obliged to give an account to
the dear public of the manner in which she appropriated the
proceeds of her honest labors. Time was, when whiskered
braggadocios in railroad cars and steamboats did not assert,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[Pg 182]</a></span>
(in blissful ignorance that they were looking the lady authoress
straight in the face!) that they were &ldquo;on the most intimate

<h2>HOW TO CURE THE BLUES.</h2>
<p class="new_para">And so you have &ldquo;the blues,&rdquo; hey! Well, I pity you!
No I don&#8217;t either; there&#8217;s no need of it. If one friend proves
a Judas, never mind! plenty of warm, generous, nice hearts
left for the winning. If you are poor, and have to sell your
free agency for a sixpence a week to some penurious relative,
or be everlastingly thankful for the gift of an old garment that
won&#8217;t hang together till you get it home! go to work like ten
thousand evil spirits, and make yourself <em>independent!</em> and
see with what a different pair of spectacles you&#8217;ll get looked
at! Nothing like it! You can have everything on earth you
want, when you don&#8217;t <em>need</em> anything.</p>

<p class="new_para">Don&#8217;t the Bible say, &ldquo;To him that hath shall be given?&rdquo; No
mistake, you see. When the wheel turns round with you on
the top, (saints and angels!) you can do anything you like&mdash;play
any sort of a prank&mdash;pout or smile, be grave or gay, saucy
or courteous, it will pass muster! You never need trouble yourself,&mdash;can&#8217;t
do anything wrong if you try. At the most, it
will only be an &ldquo;eccentricity!&rdquo; But you never need be such
a fool as to expect that anybody will find out you are a <em>diamond</em>
till you get a <em>showy setting</em>! You&#8217;ll get knocked and cuffed
around, and roughly handled, with paste and tinsel, and rubbish,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[Pg 184]</a></span>
till that auspicious moment arrives. Then! won&#8217;t all the
sheaves bow down to your sheaf?&mdash;not one rebellious straggler
left in the field! But stay a little.</p>

<p class="new_para">In your adversity, found you one faithful heart that stood
firmly by your side and shared your tears, when skies were
dark, and your pathway thorny and steep, and summer friends
fell off like autumn leaves? By all that&#8217;s noble in a woman&#8217;s
heart, give that one the first place in it now. Let the world
see <em>one</em> heart proof against the sunshine of prosperity. You
can&#8217;t repay such a friend&mdash;all the mines of Golconda couldn&#8217;t
do it. But in a thousand delicate ways, prompted by a woman&#8217;s
unerring tact, let your heart come forth gratefully, generously,
lovingly. Pray heaven he be on the shady side of
fortune&mdash;that your heart and hand may have a wider field for
gratitude to show itself. Extract every thorn from his pathway,
chase away every cloud of sorrow, brighten his lonely
hours, smooth the pillow of sickness, and press lovingly his
hand in death.</p>

<h2>RAIN IN THE CITY.</h2>

their long green tresses, and make their toilettes in the little
mirror pools beneath. The little child runs out, with outspread
palm, to catch the cool and pearly drops. The weary laborer,
drawing a long, grateful breath, bares the flushed brow of toil;
boyhood, with bare and adventurous foot, wades through gutter
rivers, forgetful of birch, and bread and butter. Ladies
skutter tiptoe, with uplifted skirts, to the shelter of some friendly
omnibus; gentlemen, in the independent consciousness of corduroys,
take their time and umbrellas, while the poor jaded
horses shake their sleek sides, but do not say <em>neigh</em> to their
impromptu shower-bath.</p>

eaves, circling the piazza, then laving their speckled breasts at
the little lakelets in the spout. Old Towser lies with his nose
to the door-mat, sniffing &ldquo;the cool,&rdquo; with the philosophy of Diogenes.
Petrarch sits in the parlor with his Laura, too happy
when some vivid lightning flash gives him an excuse for closer
quarters. Grandpapa puts on his spectacles, walks to the window,
and taking a look at the surrounding clouds, says, &ldquo;How<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[Pg 186]</a></span>

double blossoms. Forlorn experimenter! even a spinster&#8217;s
affections must centre somewhere.</p>

the nursery window, to navigate his pasteboard boat in the
street pools. There&#8217;s a flash of sunshine! What a glorious
rainbow! The little fellow tosses his arms aloft, and gazes at
it. Ten to one, the little Yankee, instead of admiring its gorgeous
splendor, is wishing he could invert it for a swing, and
seizing it at both ends, sweep through the stars with it. Well,
it is nothing new for a child to like &ldquo;the <em>milky way</em>.&rdquo;</p>

leaving the clear blue sky as serene as when &ldquo;the morning
stars first sang together.&rdquo; Nature&#8217;s gems sparkle lavishly on
glossy leaf and swaying branch, on bursting bud and flower;
while the bow of peace melts gently and imperceptibly away,
like the dying saint into the light of Heaven.</p>

said little Mr. Weasel. &ldquo;I suppose I&#8217;m what you call &lsquo;the
head of the family,&rsquo; but I shouldn&#8217;t know it if somebody didn&#8217;t
tell me of it. Heigho! who&#8217;d have thought it five and twenty
years ago? Didn&#8217;t I stifle a tremendous strong penchant for
Diana Dix, (never smoked, I remember, for four hours after it,)
because I had my private suspicions she&#8217;d hold the reins in
spite of my teeth, and so I offered myself to little Susey Snow,
(mistake in her name, by the way.) You might have spanned
her round the waist, or lifted her with one hand. She never
looked anybody in the face when they spoke to her, and her voice
was as soft as&mdash;&mdash;my brains! I declare, it&#8217;s unaccountable how
deceitful female nature is! Never was so taken in in my life;
she&#8217;s a regular Vesuvius crater! Her will? (don&#8217;t mention
it!) Try to pry up the Alps with a cambric needle! If she&#8217;d
only fly into a passion, I think I could venture to pluck up a
little spirit; but that cool, determined, never-say-die look
would turn Cayenne pepper to oil. It wilts <em>me</em> right down,
like a cabbage leaf. I&#8217;d as lief face a loaded cannon! I wish
I could go out evenings; but she won&#8217;t let me. Tom Jones<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[Pg 188]</a></span>
asked me yesterday why I wasn&#8217;t at Faneuil Hall the night
before. I told him I had the bronchitis. He saw through it!
Sent me a pair of reins the next day,&mdash;&lsquo;said to be a certain
cure!&rsquo; Ah! it&#8217;s very well for <em>him</em> to laugh, but it&#8217;s no joke
to me. I suppose it&#8217;s time to feed that baby; Mrs. Weasel
will be home pretty soon, from the &lsquo;Woman&#8217;s Rights Convention.&rsquo;
No, I won&#8217;t, either; I&#8217;ll give it some paregoric, and run
up garret and smoke one cigar. I feel as though I <em>couldn&#8217;t
look a humming-bird in the eye</em>! Nice cigar!&mdash;<em>very</em> nice!
What a fool I am to be ordered round by a little blue-eyed
woman, three feet high! I&#8217;m a very good looking fellow, and
I won&#8217;t stand it! Isn&#8217;t that little Weasel as much her baby as
it is mine? Certainly.&rdquo;</p>

frivolous tones blending discordantly with the chimes of the
Sabbath bells. And stable-keepers, oyster and ice-cream venders,
liquor sellers, <em><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">et id omne genus</span></em>, are reaping a golden harvest,

shoulders. Good heavens! that dirty mass of rags a <em>woman</em>?

the board and Love kept guard at the threshold. Oh! who can

your manliness must have been diluted with your milk. One

nor prayer, nor tear, nor lifted eye of supplication. Let her

<h2>WHEN YOU ARE ANGRY.</h2>

<p class="quote">&ldquo;When you are angry, take three breaths before you speak.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="new_para">I couldn&#8217;t do it, said Mrs. Penlimmon. Long before that
time I should be as placid as an oyster. &ldquo;Three breaths!&rdquo; I
could double Cape Horn in that time. I&#8217;m telegraphic,&mdash;if
I had to stop to reflect, I should never be saucy. I can&#8217;t hold
anger any more than an April sky can retain showers; the first
thing I know, the sun is shining. You may laugh, but that&#8217;s
better than one of your foggy dispositions, drizzling drops of
discomfort a month on a stretch; no computing whether you&#8217;ll
have anything but gray clouds overhead the rest of your life.
No: a good heavy clap of thunder for me&mdash;a lightning flash;
then a bright blue sky and a clear atmosphere, and I am ready
for the first flower that springs up in my path.</p>

<p class="new_para">&ldquo;Three breaths!&rdquo; how absurd! as if people, when they
get excited, ever <em>have</em> any breath, or if they have, are conscious
of it. I should like to see the Solomon who got off
that sage maxim. I should like better still to give him an opportunity
to test his own theory! It&#8217;s very refreshing to see
how good people can be, when they have no temptation to sin;
how they can sit down and make a code of laws for the world
in general and sinners in particular.</p>

<p class="new_para">&ldquo;Three breaths!&rdquo; I wouldn&#8217;t give a three-cent piece for
anybody who is that long about anything. The days of stage
coaches have gone by. Nothing passes muster now but comets,
locomotives and telegraph wires. Our forefathers and
foremothers would have to hold the hair on their heads if they
should wake up in 1854. They&#8217;d be as crazy as a cat in a
shower-bath, at all our whizzing and rushing. Nice old snails!
It&#8217;s a question with me whether I should have crept on at their

have discovered the New World much quicker than he did,
had I been at his elbow.</p>

<p class="new_para">School is out! What stretching of limbs; what unfettering
of tongues and heels; what tossing-up of pinafores and
primers; what visions of marbles, and hoops, and dolls, and
apples, and candy, and gingerbread! How welcome the fresh
air; how bright the sunshine; how tempting the grassy playground!
Ah, there&#8217;s a drop of rain&mdash;there&#8217;s another; there&#8217;s
a thunder clap! &ldquo;Just as school is out&mdash;how provoking!&rdquo; echo
a score of voices; and the pouting little prisoners huddle together
in the school-house porch, and console themselves by
swapping jack-knives and humming tops, and telling marvellous
stories of gypsies and giants; while Miss Prim, the dyspeptic
teacher, shakes her head and the ferule, and declares that the
former will &ldquo;fly into fifty pieces;&rdquo; upon which some of the
boys steal out of doors and amuse themselves by sounding the
puddles with their shoes, while others slyly whittle the desks,
or draw caricatures on their slates, of Miss Prim&#8217;s long nose.</p>

<p class="new_para">Drip, drip&mdash;spatter, spatter! How the rain comes down,
as if it couldn&#8217;t help it; no prospect of &ldquo;holding up.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="new_para">Here come messengers from anxious mothers, with India<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[Pg 202]</a></span>
rubbers, extra tippets, and umbrellas; and there&#8217;s a chaise at
the door, for Squire Lenox&#8217;s little rosy daughter; and a wagon
for the two Prince girls; and a stout Irish girl, with a blanket
shawl, to carry home little lame Minnie May, who is as fragile
as a lily, and just as sweet. And there&#8217;s a servant man for
Master Simpkins, the fat dunce with the embroidered jacket,
whose father owns &ldquo;the big Hotel, and wishes his son to have
a seat all by himself.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="new_para">And now they are all gone;&mdash;all save little Bessie Bell, the
new scholar,&mdash;a little four-year-older, who is doing penance
over in the corner for &ldquo;a misdemeanor.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="new_para">Bessie&#8217;s mother is a widow. She has known such bright,
sunny days, in the shelter of a happy home, with a dear arm to
lean upon! Now, her sweet face is sad and care-worn, and
when she speaks, her voice has a heart-quiver in it: but, somehow,
when she talks to you, you do not notice that her dress is
faded, or her bonnet shabby and rusty. You instinctively touch
your hat to her, and treat her very courteously, as if she were
a fine lady.</p>

<p class="new_para">As I said before, this is little Bessie&#8217;s first day at school; for,
she is light and warmth and sunshine to her broken-hearted
mother. But, little Bessie must have bread to eat. A shop
woman offered her mother a small pittance to come and help
her a part of every day; but she is not to bring her child; so,
Bessie must go to school, to be out of harm&#8217;s way, and her
mother tells Miss Prim, as she seats her on the hard bench, that
&ldquo;she is very timid and tender-hearted;&rdquo; and then she kisses
Bessie&#8217;s little quivering lip, and leaves her with a heavy heart.</p>

<p class="new_para"><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[Pg 203]</a></span></p>

<p class="new_para">Bessie dare not look up for a few minutes;&mdash;it is all very
odd and strange, and if she were not so frightened she would
cry aloud. By-and-by she gains a little courage, and peeps
out from beneath her drooping eye-lashes. Her little pinafore
neighbor gives her a sweet smile&mdash;it makes her little heart so
happy, that she throws her little dimpled arms about her neck
and says, (out loud) &ldquo;I love you!&rdquo;</p>

<p class="new_para">Poor, affectionate little Bessie! she didn&#8217;t know that that
was a &ldquo;misdemeanor;&rdquo; nor had she ever seen that bug-bear, a
&ldquo;School Committe.&rdquo; Miss Prim had;&mdash;and Miss Prim never
wasted her lungs talking; so, she leisurely untied her black silk
apron from her virgin waist, and proceeded to make an African
of little Bessie, by pinning it tightly over her face and head&mdash;an
invention which herself and &ldquo;the Committe&rdquo; considered
the <em>ne plus ultra</em> of discipline. Bessie struggled, and said she
&ldquo;never would kiss anybody again&mdash;never&mdash;never;&rdquo; but Miss
Prim was inexorable, and, as her victim continued to utter
smothered cries, Miss Prim told her &ldquo;that she would keep her
after the other children had gone home.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="new_para">One class after another recited; Bessie&#8217;s sobs became less
loud and frequent, and Miss Prim flattered herself, now that
they had ceased altogether, that she was quite subdued, and congratulated
herself complacently upon her extraordinary talent
for &ldquo;breaking in new beginners.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="new_para">And now, school being done, the children gone, her bonnet
and India rubbers being put on, and all her spinster &ldquo;fixings&rdquo;
settled to her mind, visions of hot tea and buttered toast began<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[Pg 204]</a></span>
to float temptingly through her brain, and suggest the propriety
of Bessie&#8217;s release.</p>

<p class="new_para">&ldquo;Bessie!&rdquo;&mdash;no answer. &ldquo;Bessie!&rdquo;&mdash;no reply. Miss Prim
laid the ferule across the little fat shoulders. Bessie didn&#8217;t
wince. Miss Prim unpinned the apron to confront the face that
was bold enough to defy her and &ldquo;the Committee.&rdquo; Little
Bessie was <em>dead</em>!</p>

<p class="new_para">Well; there was a pauper funeral, and a report about that
a child had been &ldquo;frightened to death at school;&rdquo; but Bessie&#8217;s
mother was a poor woman, consequently the righteous Committee
&ldquo;didn&#8217;t feel called upon to interfere with such idle reports.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="new_para">What is it to go away on a visit? Well, it is to take leave
of the little velvet rocking-chair, which adjusts itself so nicely
to your shoulders and spinal column; to cram, jam, squeeze,
and otherwise compress your personal effects into an infinitessimal
compass; to be shook, jolted, and tossed, by turns, in carriage,
railroad and steamboat; to be deafened with the stentorian
lungs of cab-drivers, draymen and porters; to clutch your
baggage as if every face you saw was a highwayman; (or to
find yourself transported with rage, at finding <em>it</em> transported by
steam to Greenland or Cape Horn.) It is to reach your friend&#8217;s
house, travel-stained, cold and weary, with an unbecoming
crook in your bonnet; to be utterly unable to get the frost out
of your tongue, or &ldquo;<em>the beam into your eye</em>,&rdquo; and to have the
felicity of hearing some strange guest remark to your friend,
as you say an early good-night, &ldquo;Is it possible <strong>that</strong> is your
friend, Miss Grey?&rdquo;</p>

<p class="new_para">It is to be ushered into the &ldquo;best chamber,&rdquo; (always a <em>north</em>
one) of a cold January night; to unhook your dress with stiffened
digits; to find every thing in your trunk <em>but</em> your night-cap;
to creep between polished <em>linen</em> sheets, on a congealed
<em>mattress</em>, and listen to the chattering of your own teeth until
daylight.</p>

<p class="new_para">It is to talk at a mark twelve hours on the stretch; to eat
and drink all sorts of things which disagree with you; to get
up sham fits of enthusiasm at trifles; to learn to yawn circumspectly
behind your finger-tips; to avoid all allusion to topics
unsuited to your pro tem. latitude; to have somebody forever
at your nervous elbow, <em>trying to make you</em> &ldquo;<em>enjoy yourself</em>;&rdquo;
to laugh when you want to cry; to be loquacious when you had
rather be taciturn; to have mind and body in unyielding harness,
for lingering, consecutive weeks; and then to invite your

with you, &ldquo;whenever business or pleasure calls them&rdquo; to Frog
town!</p>

<h2>HELEN HAVEN&#8217;S &ldquo;HAPPY NEW YEAR.&rdquo;</h2>
<p class="new_para">&ldquo;I&#8217;m miserable; there&#8217;s no denying it,&rdquo; said Helen.
&ldquo;There&#8217;s nothing in this endless fashionable routine of dressing,
dancing and visiting, that can satisfy me. Hearts enough
are laid at my feet, but I owe them all to the accidents of
wealth and position. The world seems all emptiness to me.
There <em>must</em> be something beyond this, else why this ceaseless
reaching of the soul for some unseen good? Why do the
silent voices of nature so thrill me? Why do the holy stars
with their burning eyes utter such silent reproaches? Have I
nothing to do but amuse myself with toys like a child? Shall
I live only for <em>myself</em>? Does not the sun that rises upon my
luxury, shine also upon the tear-stained face of sorrow? Are
there not slender feet stumbling wearily in rugged, lonely paths?
Why is <em>mine</em> flower-bestrewn? How am I better? Whose
sorrowful heart have I lightened? What word of comfort has
fallen from my lips on the ear of the grief-stricken? What am
I here for? What is my mission?&rdquo;</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p class="new_para">&ldquo;And you have only this wretched place to nurse that sick

<p class="new_para">&ldquo;She is not long for this world, my lady; and I love her as
well as though I had but one. Sometimes I&#8217;ve thought the
more care I have for her, the closer my heart clings to her.
She is very patient and sweet.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="new_para">&ldquo;Yes, I know,&rdquo; said Helen; &ldquo;but I have it in my power to
make her so much more comfortable. It may preserve, at
least lengthen her life.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="new_para">When little Mary opened her eyes the next morning, she
half believed herself in fairy-land. Soft fleecy curtains were
looped about her head, her little emaciated hand rested upon a
silken coverlid, a gilded table stood by her bed-side, the little
cup from which her lips were moistened was of bright silver,
and a sweet face was bending over her, shaded by a cloud of
golden hair, that fell like a glory about her head.</p>

<p class="new_para">&ldquo;Where am I?&rdquo; said the child, crossing her little hand across
her bewildered brain.</p>

<p class="new_para">Helen smiled. &ldquo;You are <em>my</em> little bird now, dear. How

<p class="new_para">&ldquo;It is very, <em>very</em> pretty,&rdquo; said Mary, with childish delight;
&ldquo;but won&#8217;t you get tired of waiting upon a poor little sick girl?
Mamma was used to it. <em>You</em> don&#8217;t look as if you could
work.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="new_para">&ldquo;Don&#8217;t I?&rdquo; said Helen, with a slight blush; &ldquo;for all that,
you&#8217;ll see how nicely I can take care of you, little one. I&#8217;ll
sing to you; I&#8217;ll read to you; I&#8217;ll tell you pretty stories; and
when you are weary of your couch, I&#8217;ll fold you in my arms,
and rock you so gently to sleep. And when you get better
and stronger, you shall have so many nice toys to play with,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[Pg 209]</a></span>
and I&#8217;ll crown your little bright head with pretty flowers, and
make you nice little dresses; and now I&#8217;m going to read to
you. Betty has been out, and bought you a little fairy story
about a wonderful puss; and here&#8217;s &lsquo;Little Timothy Pip;&rsquo;

herself by her side.</p>

<p class="new_para">That Holy Book! Helen felt as if her hands were &ldquo;unclean.&rdquo;
She began to read; perhaps the print might not have been clear;
but she stopped often, and drew her small hand across her
eyes. Her voice grew tremulous. Years of worldliness had
come between her and that sad, touching story. It came upon
her now with startling force and freshness. Earth, with its
puerile cares and pleasures, dwindled to a point. Oh, what
&ldquo;cross&rdquo; had her shoulders borne? What &ldquo;crown of thorns&rdquo;
had pierced her brows? How had her careless feet turned
aside from the footsteps of Calvary&#8217;s meek sufferer!</p>

<p class="new_para">&ldquo;Thank you,&rdquo; said little Mary, rousing Helen from her reverie;
&ldquo;mamma used to pray to God to make me patient, and
take me to Heaven.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="new_para"><span class="correction" title="Transcriber&apos;s Note: Opening double quotation mark removed.">Tears</span> started to Helen&#8217;s eyes. How could she tell that
sinless little one she <em>knew not how to pray</em>? Ah! <em>she</em> was

Oh, this was what that restless soul had craved! Here at &ldquo;the

to whining preachers, and hunting up poor dirty beggar
children! I declare, I thought she had too much good sense.
Well, there it is; and you may as well hang <em>your</em> harp on the

<p class="new_para">&ldquo;Very true,&rdquo; said Grey, as he went into the ante-room to
cloak himself for a call upon Helen; &ldquo;I <em>am</em> a sinner; but if

under that gay exterior of Helen&#8217;s there was always something<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[Pg 211]</a></span>
to which my better nature bowed in reverence. &lsquo;A Methodist,&rsquo;

Nobody ever passed Nelly without asking, &lsquo;Who is she?&rsquo;
One can&#8217;t forget the glance of that blue eye; nor the waving
of those golden locks; nor the breezy grace of that lithe figure;
nor those scarlet lips; nor the bright, glad sparkle of the whole
face; and then, she is not a bit proud, although she steps so
like a queen; she would shake hands just as quick with a horny

Well, she has; but it is because from among all her lovers she
could marry but one, and (God save us!) that her choice should
have fallen upon Walter May. If he don&#8217;t quench out the

warmly as you like, for all the sweet fancies and glowing
thoughts that have winged your lonely hours so fleetly and so
sweetly. Then you may close the book, and lean your cheek
against the cover, as if it were the face of a dear friend; shut
your eyes and soliloquise to your heart&#8217;s content, without fear
of misconstruction, even though you should exclaim in the fullness
of your enthusiasm, &ldquo;What an <em>adorable soul that man
has</em>!&rdquo; You may put the volume under your pillow, and let
your eye and the first ray of morning light fall on it together,
and no Argus eyes shall rob you of that delicious pleasure, no
carping old maid, or strait-laced Pharisee shall cry out, &ldquo;<em>it

irritating annoyances through the day, and you shall come back

silver or porcelain to guard, no more cupboards, or closets, or
canisters to explore; no more pickles or preserves to make;
no more bills of fare to invent,&mdash;and over and above all, mistress

<p class="new_para">Happy Mrs. Emily! No bird let loose from a cage was

very weary they grew, of their gloomy nursery, with its
one window, commanding a view of a dingy shed and a tall<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[Pg 221]</a></span>
spectral-looking distilhouse chimney, emitting clouds of smoke
and suffocating vapor. Nannie, the nurse, didn&#8217;t fancy it, either,
so she spent her time in the lobbies and entries, challenging
compliments from white-jacketed waiters, while the children
peeped curiously into the half-open doors, taking drafts of cold
air on their bare necks and shoulders. Sometimes they balanced
themselves alarmingly on the spiral ballustrade, gazing
down into the dizzy Babel below, inhaling clouds of cigar smoke,
and listening, with round-eyed wonder, to strange conversations,
which memory&#8217;s cud should chew, for riper years to digest.</p>

gentlemen&#8217;s broadcloth, and ladies&#8217; silk dresses being sworn foes
to <em>little Paul Pry fingers</em>. Poor little exiles! they took their
sorrowful meals in the servants&#8217; hall, with their respective nurses,
the bill of fare consisting of a rehash of yesterday&#8217;s French
dishes, (spiced for the digestion of an ostrich.) This was followed
by a dessert of stale pastry and ancient raisins, each
nurse <em>at the outset</em> propitiating her infant charge with a huge
bunch, that she might regale herself with the substantials!&mdash;mamma,
meanwhile, blissfully ignoring the whole affair, absorbed
in the sublime occupation of making German worsted dogs.</p>

<p class="new_para">Papa, too, had <em>his</em> male millennium. No more marketing
to do; no more coal, or wood, or kindling to buy; no cistern,

latitude of his nose, and surrounded by &ldquo;hale fellows well met.&rdquo;
His eldest boy accompanied him, listening, on his knee, to
questionable jokes, which he repeated at bed-time to pert Nannie,
the nurse, who understood their significance much better
than his innocent little lordship.</p>

<p class="new_para">Papa, to be sure, had <em>some</em> drawbacks, but they were <strong>very</strong>
trifling;&mdash;for instance, his shirts were quite buttonless, his
dickeys stringless, and his stockings had ventilator toes;&mdash;but

Nannie, <em>her</em> hands were full, what with babies and billet-doux.</p>

unwholesome food, and alternate heats and chills.</p>

<h2>THE STRAY SHEEP.</h2>
<p class="new_para">&ldquo;He&#8217;s going the wrong way&mdash;straying from the true fold;
going off the track,&rdquo; said old Deacon Green, shaking his head
ominously, as he saw young Neff enter a church to hear an
infidel preacher. &ldquo;Can&#8217;t understand it; he was taught his
catechism and ten commandments as soon as he could speak;
he knows the right way as well as our parson; I can&#8217;t understand
it.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="new_para">Harry Neff had never seen a day pass since his earliest
childhood, that was not ushered in and closed with a family
prayer. He had not partaken of a repast upon which the divine
blessing was not invoked; the whole atmosphere of the
old homestead was decidedly orthodox. Novels, plays and
Byronic poetry were all vetoed. Operas, theatres and the like
most decidedly frowned upon; and no lighter literature was
allowed upon the table, than missionary reports and theological
treatises.</p>

<p class="new_para">Most of his father&#8217;s guests being clergymen, Harry was
early made acquainted with every crook and turn of orthodoxy.
He had laid up many a clerical conversation, and pondered it
in his heart, when they imagined his thoughts on anything but
the subject in debate. At his father&#8217;s request, they had each<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[Pg 227]</a></span>
and all taken him by the button, for the purpose of long, private
conversations&mdash;the old gentleman generally prefacing his
request by the remark that &ldquo;his heart was as hard as a flint.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="new_para">Harry listened to them all with respectful attention, manifesting
no sign of impatience, no nervous shrinking from the
probing process, and they left him, impressed with a sense of
his mental superiority, but totally unable to affect his feelings
in the remotest degree.</p>

<p class="new_para">Such a pity! they all said, that he should be so impenetrable;
such wonderful argumentative powers as he had; such
felicity of expression; such an engaging exterior. Such a pity!
that on all these brilliant natural gifts should not have been
written, &ldquo;Holiness to the Lord.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="new_para">Yes, dear reader, it <em>was</em> a pity. Pity, when our pulpits are
so often filled with those, whose only recommendation for their
office is a good heart and a black coat. It was a pity that
graceful gesticulation, that rare felicity of expression, that keen
perception of the beautiful, that ready tact and adaptation to
circumstances and individuals, should not have been effective
weapons in the <em>gospel armory</em>. Pity, that voice of music
should not have been employed, to chain the worldling&#8217;s fastidious
ear to listen to Calvary&#8217;s story.</p>

<p class="new_para">Yet it was a pity that glorious intellect had been laid at an
unholy shrine; pity &ldquo;he had strayed from the true fold.&rdquo;
How was it?</p>

<p class="new_para">Ah! the solution is simple. &ldquo;Line upon line, precept upon
precept,&rdquo; is well&mdash;but <em>practice is better</em>! Religion <em>must not
be all lip-service</em>; the &ldquo;fruits of love, meekness, gentleness, for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[Pg 228]</a></span>bearance,
long-suffering&rdquo; must follow. Harry was a keen observer.
He had often heard the harsh and angry word from
lips upon which the Saviour&#8217;s name had just lingered. He had
felt the unjust, quick, passionate blow from the hand which a
moment before had been raised in supplication to Heaven. He
had seen the purse-strings relax at the bidding of worldliness,
and tighten at the call of charity. He had seen principle sacrificed
to policy, and duty to interest. He had himself been misappreciated.
The shrinking sensitiveness which drew a vail over
his most sacred feelings, had been harshly construed into hard-heartedness
and indifference. Every duty to which his attention
was called, was prefaced with the supposition that he was
averse to its performance. He was cut off from the gay
pleasures which buoyant spirits and fresh young life so eloquently
plead for; and in their stead no innocent enjoyment
was substituted. He saw Heaven&#8217;s gate shut most
unceremoniously, upon all who did not subscribe to the parental
creed, outraging both his own good sense and the teachings
of the Bible; and so religion, (which should have been
rendered so lovely,) put on to him an ascetic form. Oh, what
marvel that the flowers in the broad road were so passing fair
to see? that the forbidden fruit of the &ldquo;tree of knowledge&rdquo;
was so tempting to the youthful touch?</p>

<p class="new_para">Oh, Christian parent! be consistent, be judicious, be <em>cheerful</em>.
If as historians inform us, &ldquo;no smile ever played&rdquo; on the lips
of Jesus of Nazareth, surely <em>no frown marred the beauty of
that holy brow</em>.</p>

<p class="new_para">Dear reader, <em>true</em> religion is <em>not</em> gloomy. &ldquo;Her ways <em>are</em><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[Pg 229]</a></span>
ways of pleasantness, her paths <em>are</em> peace.&rdquo; No man, no woman,
has chart or compass, or guiding star, without it.</p>

<p class="new_para">Religion is not a <em>fable</em>. Else why, when our household gods
are shivered, do our tearful eyes seek only Heaven?</p>

<p class="new_para">Why, when disease lays its iron grasp on bounding life, does
the startled soul so earnestly, <em>so</em> tearfully, <em>so</em> imploringly, call
on its forgotten Saviour?</p>

<p class="new_para">Ah! the house &ldquo;built upon the sand&rdquo; may do for sunny
weather; but when the billows roll, and tempests blow, and
lightnings flash, and thunders roar, <em>we need the</em> &ldquo;<em>Rock of
Ages</em>.&rdquo;</p>

<h2>THE FASHIONABLE PREACHER.</h2>
<p class="new_para">Do you call <em>this</em> a church? Well, I heard a prima-donna
here a few nights ago: and bright eyes sparkled, and waving
ringlets kept time to moving fans; and opera glasses and ogling,
and fashion and folly reigned for the nonce triumphant. <em>I</em>
can&#8217;t forget it; I can&#8217;t get up any devotion <em>here</em>, under these
latticed balconies, with their fashionable freight. If it were a
good old country church, with a cracked bell and unhewn rafters,
a pine pulpit, with the honest sun staring in through the
windows, a pitch-pipe in the gallery, and a few hob-nailed rustics
scattered round in the uncushioned seats, I should feel all
right; but my soul is in fetters here; it won&#8217;t soar&mdash;its wings
are earth-clipped. Things are all too fine! Nobody can come
in at that door, whose hat and coat and bonnet are not fashionably
cut. The poor man (minus a Sunday suit) might lean on
his staff; in the porch, a long while, before he&#8217;d dare venture
in, to pick up <em>his</em> crumb of the Bread of Life. But, thank
God, the unspoken prayer of penitence may wing its way to
the Eternal Throne, though our mocking church spires point
only with <em>aristocratic fingers</em> to the <em>rich man&#8217;s heaven</em>.</p>

<p class="new_para">&mdash;That hymn was beautifully read; there&#8217;s poetry in the
preacher&#8217;s soul. Now he takes his seat by the reading-desk;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[Pg 231]</a></span>
now he crosses the platform, and offers his hymn-book to a
female who has just entered. What right has <em>he</em> to know there
is a woman in the house? &#8217;Tisn&#8217;t clerical! Let the bonnets
find their own hymns.</p>

<p class="new_para">Well, I take a listening attitude, and try to believe I am in
church. I hear a great many original, a great many <em>startling</em>
things said. I see the gauntlet thrown at the dear old orthodox
sentiments which I nursed in with my mother&#8217;s milk, and
which (please God) I&#8217;ll cling to till I die. I see the polished
blade of satire glittering in the air, followed by curious, eager,
youthful eyes, which gladly see the searching &ldquo;Sword of the
Spirit&rdquo; parried. Meaning glances, smothered smiles and approving
nods follow the witty clerical sally. The orator pauses
to mark the effect, and his face says, That stroke <em>tells</em>! and so
it did, for &ldquo;the Athenians&rdquo; are not all dead, who &ldquo;love to see
and hear some new thing.&rdquo; But he has another arrow in his
quiver. Now his features soften&mdash;his voice is low and thrilling,
his imagery beautiful and touching. He speaks of human
love; he touches skilfully a chord to which every heart vibrates;
and stern manhood is struggling with his tears, ere his smiles
are chased away.</p>

<p class="new_para">Oh, there&#8217;s intellect there&mdash;there&#8217;s poetry there&mdash;there&#8217;s
genius there; but I remember Gethsemane&mdash;I forget not Calvary!
I know the &ldquo;rocks were rent,&rdquo; and the &ldquo;heavens darkened,&rdquo;
and &ldquo;the stone rolled away;&rdquo; and a cold chill strikes to
my heart when I hear &ldquo;Jesus of Nazareth&rdquo; lightly mentioned.</p>

<p class="new_para">Oh, what are intellect, and poetry, and genius, when with
Jewish voice they cry, &ldquo;<em>Away with</em> <strong>Him</strong>!&rdquo;</p>

<h2>MR. PIPKIN&#8217;S IDEAS OF FAMILY RETRENCHMENT.</h2>
<p class="new_para">Mrs. Pipkin, I am under the disagreeable necessity of informing
you, that our family expenses are getting to be enormous.
I see that carpet woman charged you a dollar for one
day&#8217;s work. Why, that is positively a man&#8217;s wages;&mdash;such
presumption is intolerable. Pity you did not make it yourself,
Mrs. Pipkin; wives ought to lift their end of the yoke;
that&#8217;s my creed.</p>

<p class="new_para"><em>Little Tom Pipkin.</em>&mdash;Papa, may I have this bit of paper
on the floor? it is your tailor&#8217;s bill&mdash;says, &ldquo;$400 for your
last year&#8217;s clothes.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="new_para"><em>Mr. Pipkin.</em>&mdash;Tom, go to bed, and learn never to interrupt
your father when he is talking. Yes, as I was saying,
Mrs. Pipkin, wives should hold up their end of the yoke; and
it is high time there was a little retrenchment here; superfluities
must be dispensed with.</p>

<p class="new_para"><em>Bridget.</em>&mdash;Please, sir, there are three baskets of champagne
just come for you, and four boxes of cigars.</p>

<p class="new_para"><em>Mr. Pipkin.</em>&mdash;Will you please lock that door, Mrs. Pipkin,
till I can get a chance to say what I have to say to you
on this subject. I was thinking to-day, that you might dispense
with your nursery maid, and take care of baby yourself.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[Pg 238]</a></span>
He don&#8217;t cry much, except nights; and since I&#8217;ve slept alone
up stairs, I don&#8217;t hear the little tempest at all. It is really quite
a relief&mdash;that child&#8217;s voice is a perfect ear-splitter.</p>

<p class="new_para">I think I shall get you, too, to take charge of the marketing
and providing, (on a stipulated allowance from me, of course,)
it will give me so much more time to&mdash;&mdash;attend to <em>business</em>,
Mrs. Pipkin. I shall take my own dinners down town at the
&mdash;&mdash; House. I hear Stevens is an excellent &ldquo;caterer;&rdquo;
(though that&#8217;s nothing to me, of course, as my only object in
going is to meet business acquaintances from different parts of
the Union, to drive a bargain, &amp;c., &amp;c.)</p>

<p class="new_para">Well&mdash;it will cost you and the children little or nothing
for your dinners. There&#8217;s nothing so disgusting to a man of
refinement, like myself, as to see a <em>woman</em> fond of eating; and
as to children, any fool knows they ought not to be allowed to
stuff their skins, like little anacondas. Yes, our family expenses
are enormous. My partner sighed like a pair of bellows
at that last baby you had, Mrs. Pipkin; oh, it&#8217;s quite ruinous&mdash;but
I can&#8217;t stop to talk now, I&#8217;m going to try a splendid
horse which is offered me at a bargain&mdash;(too frisky for you
to ride, my dear, but just the thing for me.)</p>

<p class="new_para">You had better dismiss your nursery girl this afternoon;
that will begin to look like retrenchment. Good-bye; if I
am not home till late, don&#8217;t sit up for me, as I have ordered
a supper at &mdash;&mdash; House for my old friend, Tom Hillar, of
New Orleans. We&#8217;ll drink this toast, my dear: &ldquo;Here&#8217;s
hoping the last little Pipkin may never have his nose put out
of joint.&rdquo;</p>

<h2>A CHAPTER FOR NICE OLD FARMERS.</h2>
<p class="new_para">Can anybody tell why country people so universally and
pertinaciously persist in living in the <em>rear of the house</em>? Can
anybody tell why the front door and windows are never opened,
save on Fourth of July and at Thanksgiving time? Why Zedekiah,
and Timothy, and Jonathan, and the old farmer himself,
must go <em>round</em> the house in order to get <em>into</em> it? Why the
whole family (oblivious of six empty rooms,) take their &ldquo;vapor
bath,&rdquo; and their meals, simultaneously, in the vicinity of a
red hot cooking range, in the dog-days? Why the village
artist need paint the roof, and spout, and window frames bright
crimson, and the doors the color of a mermaid&#8217;s tresses?
Why the detestable sunflower (which I can never forgive &ldquo;Tom
Moore&rdquo; for noticing) must always flaunt in the garden? Why
the ungraceful prim poplar, fit emblem of a stiff old bachelor,
is preferred to the swaying elm, or drooping willow, or majestic
horse-chestnut.</p>

<p class="new_para">I should like to pull down the green paper window-curtains,
and hang up some of snowy muslin. I should like to throw
wide open the hall door, and let the south wind play through.
I should like to go out into the woods, and collect fresh, sweet
wild-flowers to arrange in a vase, in place of those defunct dried<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[Pg 240]</a></span>
grasses, and old-maid &ldquo;everlastings.&rdquo; I should like to show
Zedekiah how to nail together some bits of board, for an embryo
lounge; I should like to stuff it with cotton, and cover it
with a neat &ldquo;patch.&rdquo; I should like to cushion the chairs after
the same fashion. Then I should like, when the white-haired
old farmer came panting up the road at twelve o&#8217;clock, with
his scythe hanging over his arm, to usher him into that cool,
comfortable room, set his bowl of bread and milk before him,
and after he had discussed it, coax him (instead of tilting back
on the hind legs of a hard chair,) to take a ten-minutes nap on
my &ldquo;model&rdquo; sofa, while I kept my eye on the clouds, to see
that no thunder shower played the mischief with his hay.</p>

<p class="new_para">I should like to place a few common-sense, practical books
on the table, with some of our fine daily and weekly papers.
You may smile; but these inducements, and the comfortable
and pleasant air of the apartment, would bring the family oftener
together after the day&#8217;s toil, and by degrees they would lift
the covers of the books, and turn over the newspapers. Constant
interchange of thought, feeling and opinion, with discussions
of the important and engrossing questions of the day, would
of course necessarily follow.</p>

<p class="new_para">The village tavern-keeper would probably frown upon it;
but I will venture to predict for the inmates of the farm-house
a growing love for &ldquo;home,&rdquo; and an added air of intelligence
and refinement, of which they themselves might possibly be
unconscious.</p>

<h2>MADAME ROUILLON&#8217;S &ldquo;MOURNING SALOON.&rdquo;</h2>
<p class="new_para">&ldquo;You needn&#8217;t make that dress &lsquo;deep mourning,&rsquo; Hetty; the
lady who ordered it said it was only her sister for whom she
was to &lsquo;mourn.&rsquo; A three-quarter&#8217;s length vail will answer;
and I should introduce a few jet bugles round the bonnet trimmings.
And, by the way, Hetty, Mrs. La Fague&#8217;s husband
has been dead now nearly two months, so that new dress of
hers will admit of a little alleviation in the style of trimming&mdash;a
few knots of love-ribbon on the boddice will have a softening
effect; and you must hem a thin net vail for her bonnet;&mdash;it&#8217;s
almost time for her to be &lsquo;out of mourning.&rsquo;</p>

<p class="new_para">&mdash;&ldquo;And, Hetty, run down to Stewart&#8217;s, right away, and see
if he has any more of those grief-bordered pocket-handkerchiefs.
Mr. Grey&#8217;s servant said the border must be full an inch deep,
as his master wished it for his wife&#8217;s funeral, and it is the
eighth time within eight years that the poor afflicted man has
suffered a similar calamity. Remember, Hetty,&mdash;an inch deep,
with a tomb-stone and a weeping-willow embroidered on the
corner, with this motto: &lsquo;Hope never dies;&rsquo;&mdash;and, Hetty, be
sure you ask him what is the latest style for &lsquo;<em>half</em>-mourning&rsquo;

you &lsquo;only put them on last week;&rsquo; but they are going to Philadelphia,
where nobody knows them, and, of course, it isn&#8217;t
necessary to &lsquo;mourn&rsquo; for their mother there.</p>

<p class="new_para">&mdash;&ldquo;What are you staring at, child? You are as primitive
as your fore-mother Eve. This &lsquo;mourning&rsquo; is probably an
invention of Satan to divert people&#8217;s minds from solemn subjects,

my pocket, I&#8217;m in league with his Majesty.&rdquo;</p>

burial?&mdash;who shrinks not, starts not, when the careless,

stony-hearted, relentless Fashion! turn for us day into night,

our victim children; wring the last penny from the sighing,
overtasked, toiling husband; <em>banish to the backwoods thy

revel undisputed at the dance;&mdash;but when that grim guest,
whom none invite&mdash;whom none dare deny&mdash;strides, with
defiant front, across our threshold, stand back, thou heartless

<h2>HOUSEHOLD TYRANTS.</h2>

<p class="quote">&ldquo;A <strong>husband</strong> may kill a wife gradually, and be no more questioned than the grand
seignor who drowns a slave at midnight.&rdquo;&mdash;<em>Thackeray, on Household Tyrants.</em></p>
<p class="new_para">Oh! Mr. Thackeray! I ought to have known from experience,
that beauty and brains never travel in company&mdash;but I
<em>was</em> disenchanted when I first saw your nose, and I <em>did</em> say that
you were too stout to look intellectual. But I forgive you in
consideration of the above paragraph, which, for truth and candor,
ought to be appended to the four Gospels.</p>

<p class="new_para">I&#8217;m on the marrow bones of my soul to you, Mr. Thackeray.
I honor you for &ldquo;turning State&#8217;s evidence&rdquo; against your own
culprit-sex. If there&#8217;s any little favor I can do for you, such
as getting you naturalized, (for you are a sight too cute and
clever for an Englishman,) I&#8217;ll fly round and get the documents
made out for you to-morrow.</p>

<p class="new_para">I tell you, Mr. Thackeray, the laws over here allow husbands
to break their wives&#8217; <em>hearts</em> as much as they like, so long
as they don&#8217;t break their <em>heads</em>. So the only way we can
get along, is to allow them to scratch our faces, and then run
to the police court, and shew &ldquo;his Honor&rdquo; that Mr. Caudle
can &ldquo;<em>make his mark</em>.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="new_para">Why&mdash;if we were not <em>cunning</em>, we should get circumvented
all the time by these domestic Napoleons. Yes, in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[Pg 246]</a></span>deed;
we sleep with one eye open, and &ldquo;get up early in the
morning,&rdquo; and keep our arms a-kimbo.</p>

<p class="new_para">&mdash;By-the-way, Mr. Thackeray, what do you think of us, <em>as

many buttons you wear on your waistcoat&mdash;Jonathan never

chokes them! No mushroom aristocracy over here&mdash;no

of every copper; but who, at the same time, would

I was more of a man than you are when I was nine years old.
Your mother always made a fool of you, and that was entirely
unnecessary, too, for you were always short of what is called

<p class="new_para">Mrs. Low&#8217;s hand trembled as she passed her boy&#8217;s cup. It
was his last meal under that roof for many a long day. She
did not trust herself to speak&mdash;her heart was too full. She
heard all his father so injudiciously said to him, and she knew
too well from former experience the effect it would have upon
his impetuous, fiery spirit. She had only to oppose to it a
mother&#8217;s prayers, and tears, and all-enduring love. She never
condemned in <em>Will&#8217;s hearing</em>, any of his father&#8217;s philippics;
always excusing him with the general remark that he didn&#8217;t
understand him. <em>Alone</em>, she mourned over it; and when with
her husband, tried to place matters on a better footing for both
parties.</p>

<p class="new_para">Will noted his mother&#8217;s swollen eyelids; he saw his favorite
little tea-cakes that she had busied herself in preparing for him,

little bed with its snowy covering, and the thousand and one
little comforts prepared by his mother&#8217;s hand. He turned his
head&mdash;she was at his side, her arms about his neck. &ldquo;God
keep my boy!&rdquo; was all she could utter. He knelt at her feet
as in the days of childhood, and from those wayward lips came
this tearful prayer, &ldquo;Oh God, spare my mother, that I may
look upon her face again in this world!&rdquo;</p>

<p class="new_para">Oh, in after days, when that voice had died out from under
the parental roof, how sacred was that spot to her who gave
him birth! <em>There was hope for the boy! he had recognized
his mother&#8217;s God.</em> By that invisible silken cord she still
held the wanderer, though broad seas roll between.</p>

<p class="new_para">Letters came to Moss Glen&mdash;at stated intervals, then more
irregularly, picturing only the bright spots in his sailor life (for
Will was proud, and they were to be scanned by his father&#8217;s
eye.) The usual temptations of a sailor&#8217;s life when in port
were not unknown to him. Of every cup the syren Pleasure
held to his lips, he drank to the dregs; but there were moments
in his maddest revels, when that angel whisper, &ldquo;God
keep my boy,&rdquo; palsied his daring hand, and arrested the half-uttered
oath. Disgusted with himself, he would turn aside for
an instant, but only to drown again more recklessly &ldquo;that still
small torturing voice.&rdquo;</p>

the drowsy hum of the bee. From your pillow you can watch
the shadows come and go, over the clover meadow, as the clouds
go drifting by. Rustic neighbors lean on their spades at sunset
at your door, and with sympathising voices &ldquo;hope you are better.&rdquo;
The impatient hoof of the prancing horse is checked by
the hand of pity; and the merry shout of the sunburnt child
(musical though it be,) dies on the cherry lip, at the uplifted

death-damp from your brow; speak words of comfort to your
weeping wife, caress your unconscious children. Your fading

manly limbs, they lay your weary head on its grassy pillow,
they bedew it with sympathetic tears; they pray God, that

whisper words of peace to the broken hearts you have left behind.</p>

apple is tossed them, on their way to school. Many a ride they
get &ldquo;to mill,&rdquo; or &ldquo;hay-field,&rdquo; or &ldquo;village,&rdquo; while their mother
shades her moistened eyes in the door-way, quite unable to
speak. The old farmer sees it; and knowing better how to be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[Pg 272]</a></span>stow

cap, shawl, or dress. He&#8217;s too complacent to dispute the matter.
Strike while the iron is hot; petition for a trip to Niagara,
Saratoga, the Mammoth Cave, the White Mountains, or to
London, Rome, or Paris. Should he demur about it, the next
day cook him another turkey, and pack your trunk while he is
eating it.</p>

<span class="sub_head">OR, WHO IS RESPONSIBLE?</span></h2>


<p class="new_para">It was a simple dress of snowy muslin, innocent of the magic
touch of a French <em><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">modiste</span></em>. There was not an inch of lace upon
it, nor a rosette, nor a flower; it was pure, and simple, and unpretending
as its destined wearer. A pair of white kid gloves,
of fairy-like proportions, lay beside it, also a tiny pair of satin
slippers. There was no bridal <em><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">trousseau</span></em>; no&mdash;Meta had no
rich uncles, or aunts, or cousins,&mdash;no <em>consistent</em> god-parents
who, promising at her baptism that she should &ldquo;renounce the
pomp and vanities of the world,&rdquo; redeemed their promise by
showering at her bridal feet, diamonds enough to brighten
many a starving fellow-creature&#8217;s pathway to the tomb.</p>

<p class="new_para">Did I say there was no bridal <em><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">trousseau</span></em>? There was <em>one</em>
gift, a little clasp Bible, with &ldquo;Meta Grey&rdquo; written on the flyleaf,
in the bridegroom&#8217;s bold, handsome hand. Perchance
some gay beauty, who reads this, may curl her rosy lip scornfully;
but well Meta knew how to value such a gift. Through
long dreary years of orphanage &ldquo;God&#8217;s Word&rdquo; had been to
her what the star in the East was to Bethlehem&#8217;s watching
shepherds. Her lonely days of toil were over now. There
was a true heart, whose every pulsation was love for her&mdash;a
brave arm to defend her helplessness, and a quiet, sunny home<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[Pg 276]</a></span>
where Peace, like a brooding dove, should fold his wings, while
the happy hours flew uncounted by.</p>

<p class="new_para">Yes; Meta was looked for, every hour. She was to leave
the group of laughing hoidens, (before whom she had forbidden
her lover to claim her,) and thereafter confine her teachings
to one pupil, whose &ldquo;reward of merit&rdquo; should be the love-light
in her soft, dark eyes. Still, it was weary waiting for her; her
last letter was taken, for the hundredth time, from its hiding-place,
and read and refolded, and read again, although he could
say it all, with his eyes shut, in the darkest corner in Christendom.
But you know all about it, dear reader, if you own a
heart, and if you don&#8217;t, the sooner you drop my story the

<p class="new_para">Well; he paced the room up and down, looked out the window,
and down the street: then he sat down in the little rocking-chair
he had provided for her, and tried to imagine it was
tenanted by <em>two</em>; then, delicious tears sprang to his eyes, that
such a sweet fount of happiness was opened to him&mdash;that the
golden morn, and busy noon, and hushed and starry night,
should find them <em>ever</em> side by side. Care?&mdash;he didn&#8217;t know
it! Trouble?&mdash;what trouble could <em>he</em> have, when all his heart
craved on earth was bounded by his clasping arms? And then,
Meta was an orphan&mdash;he was scarcely sorry&mdash;there would
be none for her heart to go out to now but himself; he must
be brother, sister, father, mother&mdash;<em>all</em> to her; and his heart gave
a full and joyful response to each and every claim.</p>

<p class="new_para">&mdash;But what a little loiterer! He was half vexed; he paced
the room in his impatience, handled the little slippers affection<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[Pg 277]</a></span>ately,
and caressed the little gloves as if they were filled by the
plump hand of Meta, instead of his imagination. Why <em>didn&#8217;t</em>
she fly to him? Such an angel should have wings&mdash;he was
sure of that.</p>

<p class="new_para">&mdash;Wings? God help you, widowed bridegroom! Who

<h2>HENRY WARD BEECHER.</h2>

<p class="new_para">What a warm Sunday! and what a large church! I wonder
if it will be half-filled! Empty pews are a sorry welcome
to a pastor. Ah! no fear; here comes the congregation in
troops and families; now the capacious galleries are filled;
every pew is crowded, and seats are being placed in the aisles.</p>

<p class="new_para">The preacher rises. What a young &ldquo;David!&rdquo; Still, the
&ldquo;stone and sling&rdquo; will do their execution. How simple, how
child-like that prayer; and yet how eloquent, how fervent.
How eagerly, as he names the text, the eye of each is riveted
upon the preacher, as if to secure his individual portion of the
heavenly manna.</p>

<p class="new_para">Let us look around, upon the audience. Do you see yonder
gray-haired business man? Six days in the week, for many
years, he has been Mammon&#8217;s most devoted worshipper. According
to time-honored custom, he has slept comfortably in
his own pew each Sunday, lulled by the soft voice of the shepherd
who &ldquo;prophesieth smooth things.&rdquo; One pleasant Sabbath,
chance, (I would rather say an overruling Providence,)
led him here. He settles himself in his accustomed Sunday
attitude, but sleep comes not at his bidding. He looks disturbed.
The preacher is dwelling upon the permitted but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[Pg 286]</a></span>
fraudulent tricks of business men, and exposing plainly their
turpitude in the sight of that God who holds &ldquo;evenly the scales
of justice.&rdquo; As he proceeds, Conscience whispers to this aged
listener, &ldquo;Thou art the man!&rdquo; He moves uneasily on his
seat; an angry flush mounts to his temples: What right has
that boy-preacher to question the integrity of men of such unblemished
mercantile standing in the community as himself?
He is not accustomed to such a spiritual probing knife. <em>His</em>
spiritual physician has always &ldquo;healed the hurt of his people
slightly.&rdquo; He don&#8217;t like such plain talking, and sits the service
out only from compulsion. But when he passes the
church porch, he does not leave the sermon there, as usual.
No. He goes home perplexed and thoughtful. Conscience
sides with the preacher; self-interest tries to stifle its voice
with the sneering whisper of &ldquo;priest-craft.&rdquo; Monday comes,
and again he plunges into the maelstrom of business, and tries
to tell the permitted lie with his usual <em>nonchalance</em> to some ignorant
customer, but his tongue falters and performs its duty
but awkwardly; a slight blush is perceptible upon his countenance;
and the remainder of the week chronicles similar and
repeated failures.</p>

<p class="new_para">Again it is Sunday. He is not a church-member: he can
stay at home, therefore, without fear of a canonical committee
of Paul Prys to investigate the matter: he can look over
his debt and credit list if he likes, without excommunication:
he certainly will not put himself again in the way of that
plain-spoken, stripling priest. The bell peals out, in musical
tones, seemingly this summons: &ldquo;Come up with us, and we<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[Pg 287]</a></span>
will do you good.&rdquo; By an irresistible impulse, he finds himself
again a listener. &ldquo;Not that he <em>believes</em> what that boy
says:&rdquo; Oh no: but, somehow, he likes to listen to him, even
though he attack that impregnable pride in which he has
wrapped himself up as in a garment.</p>

<p class="new_para">Now, why is this? Why is this church filled with such
wayside listeners?</p>

<p class="new_para">Why, but that all men&mdash;even the most worldly and unscrupulous&mdash;pay
involuntary homage to earnestness, sincerity,
independence and Christian boldness, in the &ldquo;man of God?&rdquo;</p>

<p class="new_para">Why? Because they see that he stands in that sacred desk,
not that his lips may be tamed and held in, with a silver bit
and silken bridle: not because preaching is his &ldquo;trade,&rdquo; and
his hearers must receive their <em><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">quid pro quo</span></em> once a week&mdash;no,
they all see and feel that his <em>heart</em> is in the work&mdash;that he
<em>loves</em> it&mdash;that he comes to them fresh from his closet, his face
shining with the light of &ldquo;the Mount,&rdquo; as did Moses&#8217;.</p>

<p class="new_para">The preacher is remarkable for fertility of imagination, for
rare felicity of expression, for his keen perception of the complicated
and mysterious workings of the human heart, and for
the uncompromising boldness with which he utters his convictions.
His earnestness of manner, vehemence of gesture and
rapidity of utterance, are, at times, electrifying; impressing
his hearers with the idea that language is too poor and meager
a medium for the rushing tide of his thoughts.</p>

<p class="new_para">Upon the lavish beauty of earth, sea, and sky, he has evidently
gazed with the poet&#8217;s eye of rapture. He walks the
green earth in no monk&#8217;s cowl or cassock. The tiniest blade<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[Pg 288]</a></span>
of grass with its &ldquo;drap o&#8217; dew,&rdquo; has thrilled him with strange
delight. &ldquo;God is love,&rdquo; is written for him in brilliant letters,
on the arch of the rainbow. Beneath that black coat, his heart
leaps like a happy child&#8217;s to the song of the birds and the tripping
of the silver-footed stream, and goes up, in the dim old
woods, with the fragrance of their myriad flowers, in grateful
incense of praise, to Heaven.</p>

<h2>AN OLD MAID&#8217;S DECISION.</h2>

<p class="quote">&ldquo;I can bear misfortune and poverty, and all the other ills of life, but to be an <em>old
maid</em>&mdash;to droop and wither, and wilt and die, like a single pink&mdash;I can&#8217;t <em>endure</em> it;
and <em>what&#8217;s more, I won&#8217;t</em>!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="new_para">Now there&#8217;s an appeal that ought to touch some bachelor&#8217;s
heart. There she is, a poor, lone spinster, in a nicely furnished
room&mdash;sofa big enough for <em>two</em>; <em>two</em> arm chairs, <em>two</em>
bureaus, <em>two</em> looking-glasses&mdash;everything hunting in couples
except herself! I don&#8217;t wonder she&#8217;s frantic! She read
in her childhood that &ldquo;matches were made in Heaven,&rdquo; and
although she&#8217;s well aware there are some <em>Lucifer matches</em>,
yet she has never had a chance to try either sort. She has
heard that there &ldquo;never was a soul created, but its twin was
made somewhere,&rdquo; and she&#8217;s a melancholy proof that &#8217;tis a
mocking lie. She gets tired sewing&mdash;she can&#8217;t knit forever
on that eternal stocking&mdash;(besides, <em>that</em> has a <em>fellow</em> to it,
and is only an aggravation to her feelings.) She has read
till her eyes are half blind,&mdash;there&#8217;s nobody to agree with
her if she likes the book, or argue the point with her if
she don&#8217;t. If she goes out to walk, every woman she meets
has her husband&#8217;s arm. To be sure, they are half of them
ready to scratch each other&#8217;s eyes out; but that&#8217;s a little
business matter between themselves. Suppose she feels devo<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[Pg 290]</a></span>tional,
and goes to evening lectures, some ruffianly coward is
sure to scare her to death on the way. If she takes a journey,
she gets hustled and boxed round among cab-drivers, and porters,
and baggage-masters; her bandbox gets knocked in, her
trunk gets knocked off, and she&#8217;s landed at the wrong stopping
place. If she wants a load of wood, she has to pay twice
as much as a man would, and then she gets cheated by the
man that saws and splits it. She has to put her own money
into the bank and get it out, hire her own pew, and wait upon
herself into it. People tell her &ldquo;husbands are often great
plagues,&rdquo; but she knows there are times when they are indispensable.
She is very good looking, black hair and eyes, fine
figure, sings and plays beautifully, but she &ldquo;can&#8217;t be an old
maid, and <em>what&#8217;s more</em>&mdash;<strong>she won&#8217;t</strong>.&rdquo;</p>

<h2>A PUNCH AT &ldquo;PUNCH.&rdquo;</h2>

<p class="quote">&ldquo;What is the height of a woman&#8217;s ambition? Diamonds.&rdquo;&mdash;<em>Punch.</em></p>
<p class="new_para">Sagacious Punch! Do you know the reason? It is because
the more &ldquo;diamonds&rdquo; a woman owns, the more <em>precious</em>
she becomes in the eyes of your discriminating sex. What
pair of male eyes ever saw a &ldquo;crow&#8217;s foot,&rdquo; grey hair, or wrinkle,
in company with a <em>genuine diamond</em>? Don&#8217;t you go down on
your marrow-bones, and vow that the owner is a Venus, a
Hebe, a Juno, a sylph, a fairy, an angel? Would you stop to
look (<em>connubially</em>) at the most bewitching woman on earth,
whose only diamonds were &ldquo;<em>in her eye</em>?&rdquo; Well, it is no
great marvel, Mr. Punch. The race of <em>men</em> is about extinct.
Now and then you will meet with a specimen; but I&#8217;m sorry
to inform you that the most of them are nothing but coat tails,
walking behind a moustache, destitute of sufficient energy to
earn their own cigars and &ldquo;Macassar,&rdquo; preferring to dangle at
the heels of a <em>diamond</em> wife, and meekly receive their allowance,
as her mamma&#8217;s prudence and her own inclinations may
suggest.</p>

<p class="new_para">You have never heard <span class="smallcaps">Father Taylor</span>, the Boston Seaman&#8217;s
preacher? Well&mdash;you should go down to his church
some Sunday. It is not at the court-end of the town. The
urchins in the neighborhood are guiltless of shoes or bonnets.
You will see quite a sprinkling of &ldquo;Police&rdquo; at the corners.
Green Erin, too, is well represented: with a dash of Africa&mdash;checked
off with &ldquo;dough faces.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="new_para">Let us go into the church: there are no stained-glass windows&mdash;no
richly draperied pulpit&mdash;no luxurious seats to suggest
a nap to your sleepy conscience. No odor of patchouli,
or <em><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">nonpareil</span></em>, or <em><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">bouqet de violet</span></em> will be wafted across your patrician
nose. Your satin and broadcloth will fail to procure you
the highest seat in the synagogue,&mdash;they being properly reserved
for the &ldquo;old salts.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="new_para">Here they come! one after another, with horny palms and
bronzed faces. It stirs my blood, like the sound of a trumpet,
to see them. The seas they have crossed! the surging
billows they have breasted! the lonely, dismal, weary nights
they have kept watch!&mdash;the harpies in port who have assailed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">[Pg 293]</a></span>
their generous sympathies! the sullen plash of the sheeted
dead, in its vast ocean sepulchre!&mdash;what stirring thoughts and
emotions do their weather-beaten faces call into play! God
bless the sailor!&mdash;Here they come; sure of a welcome&mdash;conscious
that they are no intruders on aristocratic landsmen&#8217;s
soil&mdash;sure that each added face will send a thrill of pleasure
to the heart of the good old man, who folds them all, as one
family, to his patriarchal bosom.</p>

<p class="new_para">There he is! How reverently he drops on his knee, and utters
that silent prayer. Now he is on his feet. With a quick
motion he adjusts his spectacles, and says to the tardy tar
doubtful of a berth, &ldquo;Room here, brother!&rdquo; pointing to a seat
<em>in the pulpit</em>. Jack don&#8217;t know about <em>that</em>! He can climb
the rigging when Boreas whistles his fiercest blast; he can
swing into the long boat with a stout heart, when creaking timbers
are parting beneath him: but to mount the <em>pulpit</em>!&mdash;Jack
doubts his qualifications, and blushes through his mask of
bronze. &ldquo;Room enough, brother!&rdquo; again reässures him; and,
with a litle extra fumbling at his tarpaulin, and hitching at his
waistband, he is soon as much at home as though he were on
his vessel&#8217;s deck.</p>

<p class="new_para">The hymn is read with a <em>heart-tone</em>. There is no mistaking
either the poet&#8217;s meaning or the reader&#8217;s devotion. And now,
if you have a &ldquo;scientific musical ear,&rdquo; (which, thank heaven, I
have not,) you may criticise the singing, while I am not ashamed
of the tears that steal down my face, as I mark the effect of

that good old man, and are swept away from worldly moorings
by the flowing tide of his simple, earnest eloquence. You
marvel that these uttered truths of his, never struck your
thoughtless mind before. My pen fails to convey to you the
play of expression on that earnest face&mdash;those emphatic gestures&mdash;the
starting tear or the thrilling voice;&mdash;but they all

<p class="new_para">And now an infant is presented for baptism. The pastor
takes it on one arm. O, surely he is himself a father, else it
would not be poised so gently. Now he holds it up, that all

who doubts, should this child die to-day, its right among the
blessed?&rdquo; One murmured, spontaneous <em>No!</em> bursts from
Jacks&#8217; lips, as the baptismal drops lave its sinless temples.
Lovingly the little lamb is folded, with a kiss and a blessing,
to the heart of the earthly shepherd, ere the maternal arms
receive it.</p>

<p class="new_para">Jack looks on and weeps! And how can he help weeping?

and the sound of her loving voice, as she murmured the imploring
prayer for him: and how has her sailor boy redeemed his
youthful promise? He dashes away his scalding tears, with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">[Pg 295]</a></span>

He is about as good a judge of bonnets as I am of patent

and a stick of candy to bribe the baby to keep the peace while
mamma goes to &ldquo;meetin&rdquo; on Sunday. What a heap of people!
What a job it must be to take the census in New York.
Servant girls and their beaux, country folks and city folks, big
boys and little boys, ladies and women, puppies and men!
There&#8217;s a poor laboring man with his market basket on one
arm, and his wife on the other. He knows that he can get his
Sunday dinner cheaper by purchasing it late on Saturday night,
when the butchers are not quite sure that their stock will
&ldquo;keep&rdquo; till Monday. And then it is quite a treat for his wife,
when little Johnny is asleep, to get out to catch a bit of fresh
air, and a sight of the pretty things in the shop windows, even
if she cannot have them; but the little feminine diplomatist
knows that husbands always feel clever of a Saturday
night, and that then&#8217;s the time &ldquo;<em>just to stop and look</em>&rdquo; at a

from dawn till dark, and yet I scarce keep soul

over her shivering shoulders.</p>

<p class="new_para">Her eye fell upon the great house opposite. There was comfort

pavement, their lustrous silks, and nodding plumes, and jeweled
bracelets glistening, and quivering, and sparkling in the
bright sunlight. Now poising their silver-netted purses upon
the daintily gloved fingers, they leap lightly into the carriage
in waiting, and are whirled rapidly away.</p>

<p class="new_para">That little seamstress is as fair as they: her eyes are as soft
and blue; her limbs as lithe and graceful; her rich, brown
hair folds as softly away over as fair a brow; her heart leaps,
like theirs, to all that is bright and joyous; it craves love and
sympathy, and companionship as much, and yet she must stitch&mdash;stitch&mdash;stitch&mdash;and
droop under summer&#8217;s heat, and shiver
under winter&#8217;s cold, and walk the earth with the skeleton starvation
ever at her side, that costly pictures, and velvet carpets,

who would make them for the smallest possible remuneration;
piles of garments lay there, which such victims had already
toiled into the long night to finish, ticketed to bring enormous

<p class="new_para">A look of hopeless misery settled over the young girl&#8217;s
face, as she turned slowly away in the direction of home.
<em>Home</em> did I say? The word was a bitter mockery to poor
Mary. She had a home once, where she and the little birds
sang the live-long day: where flowers blossomed, and tall trees
waved, and merry voices floated out on the fragrant air, and
the golden sun went gorgeously down behind the far-off hills;
where a mother&#8217;s loving breast was her pillow, and a father&#8217;s
good-night blessing wooed her rosy slumbers. It was past<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">[Pg 303]</a></span>
now. They were all gone&mdash;father, mother, brother, sister.
Some with the blue sea for a shifting monument; some sleeping
dreamlessly in the little church-yard, where her infant footsteps
strayed. Rank grass had o&#8217;ergrown the cottage gravel
walks; weeds choked the flowers which dust-crumbled hands
had planted; the brown moss had thatched over the cottage
eaves, and still the little birds sang on as blithely as if Mary&#8217;s
household gods had not been shivered.</p>

<p class="new_para">Poor Mary! The world was dark and weary to her: the
very stars, with their serene beauty, seemed to mock her misery.
She reached her little room. Its narrow walls seemed
to close about her like a tomb. She leaned her head wearily
against the little window, and looked again at the great house
opposite. How brightly, how cheerfully the lights glanced
from the windows! How like fairies glided the young girls
over the softly carpeted floors! How swiftly the carriages
whirled to the door, with their gay visitors? Life was such a
rosy dream to <em>them</em>&mdash;such a brooding nightmare to <em>her</em>!
Despair laid its icy hand on her heart. Must she <em>always</em>
drink, unmixed, the cup of sorrow? Must she weep and sigh
her youth away, while griping Avarice trampled on her heart-strings?
She could not weep&mdash;nay, worse&mdash;she could not
pray. Dark shadows came between her soul and heaven.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p class="new_para">The little room is empty now. Mary toils there no longer.
You will find her in the great house opposite: her dainty limbs
clad in flowing silk; her slender fingers and dimpled arms glit<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">[Pg 304]</a></span>tering
with gems: and among all that merry group, Mary&#8217;s

glides modestly in; by her dress, she is a widow. She has
opened a small school in the neighborhood, and in the search
for scholars has wandered in here. She looks about her. Her
quick, womanly instinct sounds the alarm. She is not among
the good and pure of her sex. But she does not scorn them.
No; she looks upon their blighted beauty, with a Christ-like
pity; she says to herself, haply some word of mine may touch
their hearts. So, she says, gently, &ldquo;Pardon me, ladies, but I
had hoped to find scholars here; you will forgive the intrusion,
I know; for though you are not mothers, you have all <em>had</em>
mothers.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="new_para">Why is Mary&#8217;s lip so ashen white? Why does she tremble
from head to foot, as if smitten by the hand of God? Why

the strong blast: full-freighted omnibuses rolled over the muddy
pavements: stray pedestrians turned up their coat-collars,

unsteadily against a lamp-post, and in the maudlin accents of
intoxication curses the passers-by. A policeman&#8217;s strong grasp
is laid upon her arm, and she is hurried, struggling, through the
dripping streets, and pushed into the nearest &ldquo;station house.&rdquo;
Morning dawns upon the wretched, forsaken outcast. She sees
it not. Upon those weary eyes only the resurrection morn
shall dawn.</p>

<p class="new_para">No more shall the stony-hearted shut, in her imploring face,
the door of hope; no more shall gilded sin, with Judas smile,

the guilt-stricken one, &ldquo;Stand aside&mdash;for I am holier than
thou.&rdquo; No, none may tempt, none may scorn, none may taunt
her more. A pauper&#8217;s grave shall hide poor Mary and her
shame.</p>

<p class="new_para">God speed the day when the Juggernaut wheels of Avarice
shall no longer roll over woman&#8217;s dearest hopes; when thousands
of doors, now closed, shall be opened for starving Virtue
to earn her honest bread; when he who would coin her tears
and groans to rear his palaces, shall become a hissing and
a by-word, wherever the sacred name of Mother shall be

<span class="sub_head">NUMBER ONE.</span></h2>

<p class="new_para">&ldquo;Each to his taste,&rdquo; somebody says: so say I: so says
Gotham. Look at that splendid house, with its massive door-way,
its mammoth plate-glass windows, its tasteful conservatory,
where the snowy Orange blossom, and clustering Rose,
and crimson Cactus, and regal Passion-flower, and fragrant Heliotrope
breath out their little day of sweetness. See that
Gothic stable, with its faultless span of horses, and liveried
coachman, and anti-republican carriage, whose coat of arms
makes our National Eagle droop his fearless pinions. Then cast
your eye on that tumble-down, wooden grocery adjoining, sending
up its reeking fumes of rum, onions, and salt fish, into patrician
nostrils! Go where you will in New York, you see the
same strong contrasts. Feast your eyes on beauty, and a skeleton
startles you at its side. Lazarus sitteth ever at the Gate
of Dives.</p>

<p class="new_para">Here is a primary school: what a host of little ragged urchins
are crowding in! Suppose I step in quietly among them.
Now, they take their places in seats terraced off one above another,
so that each little face is distinctly visible. What a
pretty sight! and how Nature loves to compensate! sending
beauty to the hovel, deformity to the hall. There&#8217;s a boy,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313">[Pg 313]</a></span>
now, in that ragged jacket, who is a study for an artist. See
his broad, ample forehead; mark how his dark eyes glow:
and that little girl at his side, whose chestnut curls droop so
gracefully over her soft-fringed eyes and dimpled shoulders.
And that dream-child in yonder corner, with blue-veined, transparent
temples, whose spiritual eyes even now can see that
fadeless shore to which bright angels beckon him. Deal gently
with him&mdash;he is passing away!</p>

<p class="new_para">Here comes the teacher, brisk, angular, and sharp-voiced.
Heaven pity the children! She&#8217;s a human icicle&mdash;pastboard-y
and proper! I already experience a mental shiver. Now
she comes up and says, (apologetically to my new satin cloak,)
&ldquo;You see, madam, these are <em>only</em> poor children.&rdquo; The toadying
creature! Lucky for her that I&#8217;m not &ldquo;a committee.&rdquo; Can&#8217;t
her dull eyes recognize God&#8217;s image in linsey-woolsey?
Can she see no genius written on yonder broad forehead? No
poetry slumbering in yonder sweet eyes? Did Franklin, Clay,
and Webster study <em>their</em> alphabet in silk and velvet? She
ought to be promoted to the dignity of toe-nail polisher to
Queen Victoria. Now she hands me a book, in which visitors&#8217;
names are inscribed, and requests me to write mine. Certainly.
&ldquo;Mrs. John Smith:&rdquo; there it is. Hope she likes it as well
as I do.</p>

<p class="new_para">&mdash;Speaking of names, I read on a sign yesterday, that &ldquo;Richard
Haas:&rdquo; to-day I saw, down street, that &ldquo;John Haas.&rdquo;
I&#8217;m sure I&#8217;m glad of it. I congratulate both those enterprising
gentlemen. There goes a baker&#8217;s cart, with &ldquo;Ernest Flog-er&rdquo;

Ernest, &ldquo;<em>your</em> cake will be dough;&rdquo; 1853 being considered the

Battery. &ldquo;<em>Fanfernot</em> &amp; Dulac:&rdquo; that must be a chain-lightning
firm. Wonder if &ldquo;Fanfernot&rdquo; is the <em>silent</em> partner?</p>

<p class="new_para">Here&#8217;s a man distributing tracts. Now, if he hands me one,
I&#8217;ll throw it down. See how meekly he picks it up, and hands
me another. &ldquo;That&#8217;s right, friend Colporteur, I only wanted
to see if you were in earnest: glad to see you so well
employed.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="new_para">&ldquo;Yes, Ma&#8217;am,&rdquo; he says, much relieved, &ldquo;sinners here in New
York need waking up&rdquo;&mdash;which sentiment I endorse, and advise
him to call at the <em><abbr title="New York">N. Y.</abbr> Tribune</em> office.</p>

<p class="new_para">Down comes the rain: had I taken my umbrella, not a drop
would have fallen. &ldquo;I &#8217;spect&rdquo; I was born on a Friday; but
as that can&#8217;t be helped now, I&#8217;ll step into that book-store till the
shower is over. The owner politely gives me a chair, and then
hands me, for my edification, the <em>last fashion prints</em>!<span class="spaced"> Fanny
Fern</span>! can it be possible that you look so frivolous?
Tracts and fashion prints, both offered you in one forenoon!
Wonder if there&#8217;s a second-hand drab Quaker bonnet anywhere,
that will subdue your &ldquo;style?&rdquo;</p>

<p class="new_para">See that little minstrel in front of the store, staggering under
the weight of a hand-organ. What a crowd of little beggar-boys
surround him, petitioning &ldquo;for <em>just one tune</em>.&rdquo; Now,
I wonder if the rough school that boy has been in, has hardened
his heart? Has he grown prematurely worldly-wise and
selfish? Will he turn gruffly away from that penniless,
Tom Thumb audience, or will he give them a <em>gratuitous</em><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315">[Pg 315]</a></span>
tune? God be thanked, his childish heart yet beats warm
and true under that tattered jacket. He smiles sweetly on the
eager group, and strikes up &ldquo;Lang Syne.&rdquo; Other than mortal
ears are listening! That deed, unnoticed by the hurrying
Broadway throng, is noted by the Recording Angel. &ldquo;Inasmuch
as ye have done it unto one of the least of these, ye have
done it unto Me.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="new_para">Sunshine again! dripping awnings and sloppy pavements.
There&#8217;s a man preaching an out-door temperance sermon: what
a bungling piece of work he makes of it! If he would lend me
that pro tem barrel-pulpit I&#8217;d astonish <em>him</em>, and take the feather
out of &ldquo;Miss Lucy Stone&#8217;s&rdquo; bonnet.</p>

<p class="new_para">Let us cross the Park. There&#8217;s an Irishman seated on the
withered grass, with his spade beside him, leaning wearily
against that leafless tree. I wonder is he ill? I must walk
that way and speak to him. What a sudden change comes
over his rough face! it looks quite beautiful. Why do his eyes
kindle? Ah, I see: a woman approaches from yonder path;
now she seats herself beside him, on the grass, and drawing the
cover from a small tin kettle, she bends over the steaming contents,
and says, with a smile, that is a perfect heart-warmer,
&ldquo;<em>Dear</em> Dennis!&rdquo; Oh, what a wealth of love in those two simple
words; what music in that voice! Who says human nature
is <em>all</em> depravity? Who says this earth is but a charnel-house
of withered hopes? Who says the &ldquo;Heart&#8217;s Ease&rdquo;
springs never from the rock cleft? Who says it is only on
<em>patrician</em> soil the finer feelings struggle into leaf and bud and
blossom? No&mdash;no&mdash;that humble, faithful creature has trav<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_316" id="Page_316">[Pg 316]</a></span>eled
weary miles with needful food, that &ldquo;Dennis&rdquo; may waste
no unnecessary time from labor. And there they sit, side by
side, happy and blessed in each other, deaf to the ceaseless tide
of business and pleasure flowing past, blind to the supercilious
gaze of the pompous millionaire, the curious stare of pampered
beauty, the derisive laugh of &ldquo;Young America,&rdquo; and the little
romance they have set my brain a-weaving! What a pretty
episode amid all this Babel din! What a delicious little bit
of nature midst this fossil hearted Gotham!</p>

<p class="new_para">How true&mdash;how beautiful the words of Holy Writ! &ldquo;Better

Why does he beckon that short man to his side?
Well, I declare! everything comical comes to my net! He
has taken out a slip of paper, and using the short man&#8217;s head
for a writing-desk, is scribbling off some directions for a porter
in waiting! The lamb-like non-resistance of the short man is

<p class="new_para">The fashionables are yet yawning on their pillows. Nobody
is abroad but the workies. So much the better. Omnibus
drivers begin to pick up their early-breakfast customers. The
dear little children, trustful and rosy, are hurrying by to school.
Apple women are arranging their stalls, and slyly polishing
their fruit with an old stocking. The shopkeepers are placing
their goods in the most tempting light, in the store windows;
and bouquet venders, with their delicious burthens, have already
taken their stand on the saloon and hotel steps.</p>

<p class="new_para">Here come that de-socialized class, the New York business
men, with their hands thrust moodily into their coat pockets,
their eyes buttoned fixedly down to the sidewalk, and &ldquo;the almighty
dollar&rdquo; written legibly all over them. If the automatons
would but show <em>some</em> sign of life; were it only by a whistle.
I&#8217;m very sure the tune would be</p>

What have you there, little ones? Five little, fat,
roly-poly puppies, as I live, all heads and tails, curled up in that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_318" id="Page_318">[Pg 318]</a></span>
comical old basket! And you expect to get &ldquo;a dollar apiece&rdquo;
for them? Bless your dear little souls, Broadway is full of
&ldquo;puppies,&rdquo; who never &ldquo;bring&rdquo; anything but odious cigar smoke,
that ever I could find out. Puppies are at a discount, my darlings.
Peanuts are a safer investment.</p>

<p class="new_para">Here we are at Trinity Church. I doubt if human lips within
those walls ever preached as eloquently as those century
grave-stones. How the sight of them involuntarily arrests the
bounding footstep, and the half-developed plan of the scheming
brain, and wakes up the slumbering immortal in our nature.
How the eye turns a questioning glance from those moss-grown
graves, inward&mdash;then upward to the soft, blue heavens above
us. How for a brief moment the callous heart grows kindly,
and we forget the mote in our brothers eye, and cease to repulse
the outspread palm of charity, and recognise the claims
of a common brotherhood; and then how the sweeping tide
comes rolling over us, and the clink of dollars and cents drowns
&ldquo;the still small voice,&rdquo; and Eternity recedes, and Earth only
seems tangible, and Mammon, and Avarice, and Folly rule the
never returning hours.</p>

<p class="new_para">Now glance over the church-yard yonder into the street below.
Cholera and pestilence, what a sight! flanked on one
side by the charnel-house, on the other by houses whose basements
are groggeries and markets, and at whose every pane of
glass may be seen a score of dirty faces: the middle of the
street a quagmire of jelly-mud, four inches deep, on which are
strewn, ad-infinitum, decayed potatoes and cabbage stumps, old
bones and bonnets, mouldy bread, salt fish and dead kittens.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_319" id="Page_319">[Pg 319]</a></span>
That pussy-cat New York corporation should be put on a diet
of peppered thunder and gunpowder tea, and harnessed to a
comet for six months. I doubt if even then the old poppies
would wake up.</p>

<p class="new_para">Do you see that piece of antiquity playing the bagpipe?
He is as much a fixture as your country cousin. There he
sits, through heat and cold, squeezing out those horrible sounds
with his skinny elbow, and keeping time with his nervous eye-winkers.
He gets up his own programme, and is his own orchestra,
door-keeper and audience: nobody stops to listen, nobody
fees him, nobody seems to enjoy it so hugely as himself.</p>

<p class="new_para">Who talks about wooden nutmegs in the hearing of Gotham?
Does a shower come up? Men start up as if by magic, with
all-sized India rubbers for sale, and ragged little boys nudge
your elbows to purchase &ldquo;cheap cotton umbrellas.&rdquo; Does the
wind veer round south? A stack of palm-leaf fans takes the
place of the umbrellas. Have you the misfortune to trip upon
the sidewalk? a box of Russia salve is immediately unlidded
under your nose. Do you stop to arrange your gaiter boot?
whole strings of boot-lacings are dangled before your astonished
eyes. Do your loosened waistbands remind you of the
dinner hour? before your door stands a man brandishing &ldquo;patent
carving knives,&rdquo; warranted to dissever the toughest old
rooster that ever crowed over a hen harem.</p>

<p class="new_para">Speaking of hens&mdash;see that menagerie, in one of the handsomest
parts of Broadway, defaced by that blood and murder
daub of a picture, representing every animal that ever flew or
trotted into Noah&#8217;s ark, beside a few that the good old gentle<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_320" id="Page_320">[Pg 320]</a></span>man
never undertook to perpetuate. See them lashing their
tails, bristling their manes, ploughing the air and tossing high
above their incensed horns, that distracted gory biped, whose
every individual hair is made to stand on end with horror, and
his coat-tail astonishingly to perpendicularize. Countrymen
stand agape while pickpockets lighten them of their purses;
innocent little children, with saucer eyes, shy to the further
edge of the sidewalk, and hurry home with an embryo nightmare
in their frightened craniums. &ldquo;Jonathan&rdquo; pays his
&ldquo;quarter,&rdquo; and is astonished to find upon entering, a very tame
collection of innocent beasts and beastesses, guiltless of any intention
to growl, unless poked by the long pole of curiosity.
Dissatisfied, he descends to the cellar, to see the elephant, who
holds a sleepy levee, for all who feel inclined to pack his trunk
with the apples and cake, which a shrewd stall-keeping Yankee
in the corner disinterestedly advises them to buy, &ldquo;just to see
how the critter eats.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="new_para">Well; two-headed calves, one-eyed buffaloes, skeleton ostriches,
and miles of serpents, are every day matters; but yonder
is an announcement that &ldquo;Two Wild Men from Borneo&rdquo;
may be seen within. Now that interests me. &ldquo;They have the
faculty of speech, but are deficient in memory.&rdquo; Bless me,
you don&#8217;t mean to say that those little Hop o&#8217; my Thumbs
have the temerity to call themselves &ldquo;<em>Men?</em>&rdquo; little humbug,
pocket editions. But what pretty little limbs they have, and how
they shiver in this cold climate, spite of the silk and India-rubber
dress they wear under those little tights. &ldquo;The youngest weighs
only twenty-seven, the oldest thirty-four pounds;&rdquo; so the keeper<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_321" id="Page_321">[Pg 321]</a></span>
says, who, forming a circle, lays one hand on the head of each, and
commences his stereotyped, menagerie exordium, oblivious of
commas, colons, semi-colons, periods or breath; adding at the
close, that the Wild Men will now shake hands with any child
who may be present, but will <span class="correction" title="Transcriber&apos;s Note: Quotation mark added.">&ldquo;<em>always bite an adult</em></span>.&rdquo; Nothing
like a barrier to make femininity leap over. I&#8217;m bent upon
having the first &ldquo;adult&rdquo; shake. The keeper says, &ldquo;Better not,
Ma&#8217;am,&rdquo; (showing a scar on his finger,) &ldquo;they bit that een-a-most
to the bone.&rdquo; Of course, snapping at masculinity, is no proof
to me of their unsusceptibility to feminine evangelization; on
the contrary. So, taking a cautious patrol around the interesting
little savages, I hold out my hand. Allah be praised! they
take it, and my five digits still remain at the service of printers
and publishers!</p>

Heaven help <em>Mrs.</em> Boots, when her husband finds a button missing!

Lucky for the poor invalid that our gallant host has a heart
warm and true. How tenderly he lifts the invalid to his room;
how expeditiously he dispatches his orders for a Spanish doctor
and nurse; how imploringly the sufferer&#8217;s speaking eyes are
fastened upon his face. Ah! Death glided in at yonder door
with the sick man; his grasp is already on his heart; the doctor
stands aside and folds his hands&mdash;there&#8217;s no work for <em>him</em>
to do; dark shadows gather round the dying stranger&#8217;s eyes;
he presses feebly the hand of his humane host, and gasps out
the last fluttering breath on that manly heart. Strange hands
are busy closing his eyes; strange hands straighten his limbs;
a strange priest comes all too late to shrive the sick man&#8217;s soul;
strange eyes gaze carelessly upon the features, one glimpse of
which were worth Golconda&#8217;s mines to far-off kindred. Now
the undertaker comes with the coffin. Touch him gently, man
of business; lay those dark locks tenderly on the satin pillow;
hear you not a far-off wail from sunny Spain, as the merry song
at the vintage feast dies upon the lip of the stricken-hearted?</p>

<h2>TWO PICTURES.</h2>

prayer-meeting. She is secretary to the &ldquo;Moral Reform,&rdquo;
&ldquo;Abolition,&rdquo; &ldquo;Branch Colporteur and Foreign Mission&rdquo; Societies.
She is tract distributor, manager of an &ldquo;Infant School,&rdquo;
cuts out all the work for the Brown Steeple Sewing Circle;
belongs to the &ldquo;Select Female Prayer Meeting;&rdquo; goes to the
Friday night church meeting, Tuesday evening lecture, and
Saturday night Bible Class, and attends three services on Sunday.
Every body says, &ldquo;What an eminent Christian is Mrs.
Judkins!&rdquo;</p>

<p class="new_para">Mrs. Judkins&#8217; house and servants take care of themselves.
Her little boys run through the neighborhood, peeping into
grocery and provision stores, loitering at the street corners, and
throwing stones at the passers-by. Her husband comes home
to a disorderly house, eats indigestible dinners, and returns to
his gloomy counting-room, sighing that his hard earnings are
wasted, and his children neglected; and sneering at the <em>religion</em>
which brings forth such questionable fruits.</p>

telling her that she in particular, and the church in general, have
been pained to notice Mrs. Brown&#8217;s absence from the various
religious gatherings and societies above mentioned; that it is
a matter of great grief to them, that she is so lukewarm, and
does not enjoy religion as much as they do.</p>

<p class="new_para">Mrs. Brown has a sickly infant; her husband (owing to sad
reverses) is in but indifferent circumstances; they have but one
inexperienced servant. All the household outgoings and incomings,
must be carefully watched, and looked after. The little
wailing infant is never out of the maternal arms, save when its
short slumbers give her a momentary reprieve. Still, the
little house is in perfect order. The table tasteful and tempting,
although the bill of fare is unostentatious; the children
are obedient, respectful, happy and well cared for. Morning
and evening, amid her varied and pressing cares, she bends the
knee in secret, to Him whom her maternal heart recognizes as
&ldquo;My Lord and my God.&rdquo; No mantle of dust shrouds the
&ldquo;Holy Book.&rdquo; The sacred <em>household</em> altar flame never dies out.
Little dimpled hands are reverently folded; little lips lisping

finds the patient mother in her accustomed place in the sanctuary.
At her hearth and by her board, the holy man of God

<h2>FEMININE WAITERS AT HOTELS.</h2>

<p class="quote">&ldquo;Some of our leading hotel-keepers are considering the policy of employing female
waiters.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="new_para">Good news for you, poor pale-faced sempstresses! Throw
your thimbles at the heads of your penurious employers; put
on your neatest and <em>plainest</em> dress; see that your feet and fingers
are immaculate, and then rush <em><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">en masse</span></em> for the situation,
ousting every white jacket in Yankeedom. Stipulate with your
employers, for leave to carry in the pocket of your French
apron, a pistol loaded with cranberry sauce, to plaster up the
mouth of the first coxcomb who considers it necessary to preface
his request for an omelette, with &ldquo;<em>My dear</em>.&rdquo; It is my
opinion that one such hint will be sufficient; if not, you can
vary the order of exercises, by anointing him with a &ldquo;<strong>hasty</strong>
plate of soup&rdquo; at dinner.</p>

<p class="new_para">Always make a moustache wait twice as long as you do a
man who wears a clean, presentable lip. Should he undertake
to expedite your slippers by &ldquo;a fee,&rdquo; tell him that hotel bills
are <em>generally</em> settled at the clerk&#8217;s office, except by <em>very</em> verdant
travelers.</p>

<p class="new_para">Should you see a woman at the table, digging down to the
bottom of the salt cellar, as if the top stratum were too plebe<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_333" id="Page_333">[Pg 333]</a></span>ian;
or ordering ninety-nine messes (turning aside from each
with affected airs of disgust,) or rolling up the whites of her
eyes, declaring that she never sat down to a dinner-table before
minus &ldquo;finger glasses,&rdquo; you may be sure that her aristocratic
blood is nourished, <em>at home</em>, on herrings and brown bread.
When a masculine comes in with a white vest, flashy neck-tie,
extraordinary looking plaid trousers, several yards of gold chain
festooned over his vest, and a mammoth seal ring on his little
finger, you may be sure that his tailor and his laundress are
both on the anxious seat; and whenever you see travelers
of <em>either</em> sex peregrinating the country in their &ldquo;best bib and
tucker,&rdquo; you can set them down for unmitigated &ldquo;snobs,&rdquo; for
high-bred people can&#8217;t afford to be so extravagant!</p>

<p class="new_para">I dare say you&#8217;ll get sick of so much pretension and humbug.
Never mind; it is better than to be stitching yourselves
into a consumption over six-penny shirts; you&#8217;ll have your
fun out of it. This would be a horridly stupid world, if every
body were sensible. I thank my stars every day, for the share
of fools a kind Providence sends in my way.</p>

<h2>LETTER TO THE EMPRESS EUGENIA.</h2>

<p class="quote"><span class="smallcaps">A Paris Letter</span> says:&mdash;Lady Montijo has left Paris for Spain. She was extremely
desirous of remaining and living in the reflection of her daughter&#8217;s grandeur,
but Louis Napoleon, who shares in the general prejudice against step-mothers, gave
her plainly to understand, that because he had married Eugenia, she must not suppose
he had married her whole family. She was allowed to linger six weeks, to have
the <em><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">entree</span></em> of the Tuileries, and to see her movements chronicled in the <em><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Pays</span></em>. She
has at last left us, and the telegraph mentions her arrival at Orleans, on her way to
the Peninsula.</p>
<p class="new_para">There Teba! did not I say you would need all those two-thousand-franc
pocket-handkerchiefs before your orange wreath
had begun to give signs of wilting? Why did you let your
mamma go, you little simpleton? Before Nappy secured your
neck in the matrimonial noose, you should have had it put
down, in black and white, that Madame Montijo was to live
with you till&mdash;the next revolution, if you chose to have her.
Now you have struck your colors, of course everything will
&ldquo;go by the board.&rdquo; I tell you Teba, that a fool is the most
unmanageable of all beings. He is as dogged and perverse as
a broken-down donkey. You can neither goad nor coax him
into doing anything he should do, or prevent his doing what he
should not do. You will have to leave Nappy and come over
here;&mdash;and then everybody will nudge somebody&#8217;s elbow and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_335" id="Page_335">[Pg 335]</a></span>
say, &ldquo;That is Mrs. Teba Napoleon, who does not live with her
husband.&rdquo; And some will say it is your fault; and others will
say &#8217;tis his; and all will tell you a world more about it, than
<em>you</em> can tell <em>them</em>.</p>

<p class="new_para">Then, Mrs. Samuel Snip (who has the next room to yours,
who murders the king&#8217;s English most ruthlessly, and is not
quite certain whether Barnum or Christopher Columbus discovered
America,) will have her Paul Pry ear to the keyhole
of your door about every other minute, (except when her husband
is on duty,) to find out if you are properly employed;&mdash;and
no matter what Mrs. Snip learns, or even if she does not
learn anything, she will be pretty certain to report, that, in her
opinion, you are &ldquo;no better than you should be.&rdquo; If you dress
well (with your splendid form and carriage you could not but
seem well-dressed) she will &ldquo;wonder how you got the means
to do it&rdquo;; prefacing her remark with the self-evident truth
that, &ldquo;to be sure, it is none of her business.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="new_para">If you let your little Napoleon get out of your sight a minute,
somebody will have him by the pinafore and put him
through a catechism about his mamma&#8217;s mode of living and
how she spends her time. If you go to church, it will be &ldquo;to
show yourself;&rdquo; if you stay at home, &ldquo;you are a publican and
a sinner.&rdquo; Do what you will, it will all be wrong: if you do
nothing, it will be still worse. Our gentlemen (so called)
knowing that you are defenceless and taking it for granted that
your name is &ldquo;Barkis,&rdquo; will all stare at you; and the women
will dislike and abuse you just in proportion as the opposite<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_336" id="Page_336">[Pg 336]</a></span>
sex admire you. Of course you will sweep past them all, with
that magnificent figure of yours, and your regal chin up in the

of their pigmy existence.</p>

by the glare of gas-light, have I, with a gipsey longing, wished

over my head, that the tide of music might unfettered flow
over my soul.</p>

<p class="new_para">How often, when dumb with delight, in the midst of some

<h2>FOR LADIES THAT &ldquo;GO SHOPPING.&rdquo;</h2>

<p class="new_para">Matrimony and the toothache <em>may</em> be survived, but of all
the evils feminity is heir to, defend me from a shopping excursion.
But, alas! bonnets, shoes and hose will wear out, and
shop-keepers will chuckle over the sad necessity that places the
unhappy owners within their dry-goods clutches. Felicitous
Mrs. Figleaf! why taste that Paradisaical apple?</p>

<p class="new_para">Some victimised females frequent the stores where soiled
and damaged goods are skillfully announced as selling at an
&ldquo;immense sacrifice,&rdquo; by their public-spirited and disinterested
owners. Some courageously venture into more elegant establishments,
where the claim of the applicant to notice, is measured
by the costliness of her apparel, and where the clerks poise
their eye-glass at any plebeian shopperess bold enough to inquire
for silk under six dollars a yard. Others, still, are tortured at
the counter of some fussy old bachelor, who always ties up,
with distressing deliberation, every parcel he takes down for inspection,
before he can open another, and moves round to execute
your orders as if Mt. Atlas were fastened to his heels; or
perhaps get petrified at the store of some snap-dragon old maid,
whose victims serve as escape-valves for long years of bile, engendered
by Cupid&#8217;s oversights. Meanwhile, the vexed ques<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_340" id="Page_340">[Pg 340]</a></span>tion
is still unsolved, Where can the penance of shopping be
performed with the least possible wear and tear of patience and
prunella? The answer seems to me to be contained in six letters&mdash;&ldquo;Stewart&#8217;s.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="new_para">&ldquo;<em>Stewart&#8217;s?</em>&rdquo; I think I hear some old lady exclaim, dropping
her knitting and peering over her spectacles; &ldquo;Stewart&#8217;s!
yes, if you have the mines of California to back you.&rdquo; Now
I have a profound respect for old ladies, as I stand self-pledged
to join that respectable body on the advent of my very first
gray hair; still, with due deference to their catnip and pennyroyal
experience, I conscientiously repeat&mdash;&ldquo;<em>Stewart&#8217;s</em>.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="new_para">You may stroll through his rooms free to gaze and admire,
without being annoyed by an impertinent clerk dogging your
footsteps; you can take up a fabric, and examine it, without
being bored by a statement of its immense superiority over
every article of the kind in the market, or without being deafened
by a detailed account of the enormous sums that the
mushroom aristocracy have considered themselves but <em>too</em> happy
to expend, in order to secure a dress from that very desirable,
and altogether unsurpassed, and unsurpassable, piece of
goods!</p>

<p class="new_para">You can independently say that an article does not exactly
suit you, though your husband may not stand by you with a
drawn sword. You will encounter no ogling, no impertinent
cross-questioning, no tittering whispers, from the quiet, well-bred
clerks, who attend to their own business and allow you to
attend to yours.</p>

<p class="new_para">&#8217;Tis true that you may see at Stewart&#8217;s, cobweb laces an inch<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_341" id="Page_341">[Pg 341]</a></span>
or two wide, for fifty or one hundred dollars a yard, which many
a brainless butterfly of fashion is supremely happy in sporting:
but at the very next counter you may suit yourself, or
your country cousin, to a sixpenny calico, or a shilling de laine;
and, what is better, be quite as sure that her verdant queries
will be as respectfully answered as if liveried Pompey stood
waiting at the door to hand her to her carriage.</p>

<p class="new_para">You can go into the silk department, where, by a soft descending
light, you will see dinner dresses that remind you of
a shivered rainbow, for <em><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">passé</span></em> married ladies who long since
ceased to celebrate their birth-days, and who keep their budding
daughters carefully immured in the nursery: or, at the
same counter, you can select a modest silk for your minister&#8217;s
wife, at six shillings a yard, that will cause no heart-burnings in
the most Argus-eyed of Paul Pry parishes.</p>

<p class="new_para">Then if you patronise those ever-to-be-abominated and always-to-be-shunned
nuisances called parties, where fools of both
sexes gather to criticise their host and hostess, and cut up characters
and confectionary, you can step into that little room
from which day-light is excluded, and select an evening dress,
<em>by gas-light</em>, upon the effect of which you can, of course, depend,
and to which artistic arrangement many a New York
belle has probably owed that much prized possession&mdash;her
&ldquo;last conquest.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="new_para">Now, if you please, you can go into the upholstery-room
and furnish your nursery windows with a cheap set of plain
linen curtains; or you can expend a small fortune in regal crimson,
or soft-blue damask drapery, for your drawing-room; and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_342" id="Page_342">[Pg 342]</a></span>
without troubling yourself to thread the never-ending streets of
Gotham for an upholsteress, can have them made by competent
persons in the upper loft of the building, who will also drape
them faultlessly about your windows, should you so desire.</p>

<p class="new_para">Now you can peep into the cloak room, and bear away on
your graceful shoulders a six, twenty, thirty, or four hundred
dollar cloak, as the length of your husband&#8217;s purse, or your own
fancy (which in these degenerate days amounts to pretty much
the same thing) may suggest.</p>

<p class="new_para">Then there is the wholesale department, where you will see
shawls, hosiery, flannels, calicoes, and de laines, sufficient to stock
all the nondescript country stores, to say nothing of city consumption.</p>

<p class="new_para">Now, if you are not weary, you can descend (under ground)
into the carpet department, from whence you can hear the incessant
roll of full-freighted omnibuses, the ceaseless tramp of
myriad restless feet, and all the busy train of out-door life
made audible in all the dialects of Babel. Here you can see
every variety of carpet, from the homespun, unpretending
straw, oil cloth, and Kidderminster, to the gorgeous Brussels and
tapestry, (above whose traceried buds and flowers the daintiest
foot might well poise itself, loth to crush,) up to the regal Axminster,
of Scottish manufacture, woven without seam, and
warranted, in these days of late suppers and tobacco smoking,
<em>to last a life-time</em>.</p>

<p class="new_para">Emerging from this subterranean region, you will ascend into
daylight, and reflecting first upon all this immense outlay, and
then upon the frequent and devastating conflagrations in New<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_343" id="Page_343">[Pg 343]</a></span>

although Argus-eyed watchmen keep up a night-and-day patrol

<h2>MODERN IMPROVEMENTS.</h2>

<p class="new_para">&ldquo;Modern improvements?&rdquo; I wonder where they are?
Perhaps it is the fashionable cloaks, that take leave of their shivering
owners at the hips; or the long skirts, whose muddy
trains every passing pedestrian pins to the sidewalk; or the
Lilliputian bonnets, that never a string in shop-dom can keep
within hailing distance of the head; or the flowing sleeves,
through which the winter wind plays around the arm-pits; or
the break-neck, high-heeled boots, which some little, dumpy
feminine has introduced to gratify her <em>rising</em> ambition, and render
her tall sisters hideous; or the gas-lit, furnace-heated houses,
in which the owners&#8217; eyes are extinguished, and their skins
dried to a parchment; or, perhaps, it is the churches, of such
cathedral dimness, that the clergyman must have candles at
noonday, and where the congregation are forbidden to express
their devotion by singing, and forced to listen to the trills and
quavers of some scientific stage mountebank; or perhaps &#8217;tis
the brazen irreverence with which Young America jostles aside
gray-headed Wisdom: perhaps the comfortless, forsaken fireside
of the &ldquo;strong-minded woman:&rdquo; perhaps, the manly gossip,
whose repetition of some baseless rumor dims the bright
eyes of defenceless innocence with tears of anguish: perhaps<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_345" id="Page_345">[Pg 345]</a></span>
the schools, where a superficial show of brilliancy on exhibition
days, is considered the ne plus ultra of teaching: perhaps
it is the time-serving clergyman, whose tongue is fettered by a
monied clique: perhaps, the lawyers who lie&mdash;under a mistake!&mdash;perhaps
it is the doctor, whom I saw yesterday at Aunt
Jerusha&#8217;s sick-room, a little thing with bits of feet, and mincing
voice, and lily-white hands, and perfumed moustache. I wanted
to inquire what ailed Jerusha, so I waited to see him. I wanted
to ask him how long it would take him to cure her, and if he
preferred pills to powders, blisters to plasters, oat-meal to
barley-gruel, wine-whey to posset, arrow-root to farina, and a
few such little things, you know. He stared at me over his
dicky, as if I had been an unevangelized kangaroo; then he
sidled up to Jerusha, pryed open her mouth, and said &ldquo;humph&rdquo;&mdash;in
Latin. Then he crossed his legs, and rolled up the whites
of his eyes at the ceiling, as if he expected some Esculapian hand
writing on the wall to enlighten him as to the seat of Aunt Jerusha&#8217;s
complaint. Then, he drew from his pocket a box with
a whole army of tiny bottles; and uncorking two of them he
nipped out a little white speck from each, which he dissolved
in four quarts of water, and told Jerusha &ldquo;to take a drop of
the water once in eight hours.&rdquo; Tom Thumb and Lilliput! he
might as well have tried to salt the Atlantic Ocean with a widower&#8217;s
tear! He should be laid gently on a lily leaf, and consigned
to the first stray zephyr.</p>

<p class="new_para">Ah, you should have seen our good, old-fashioned Dr. Jalap;
with a fist like a sledge-hammer, a tramp like a war-horse, and
a laugh that would puzzle an echo. He wasn&#8217;t penurious of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_346" id="Page_346">[Pg 346]</a></span>
<em>his</em> physic: <em>he</em> didn&#8217;t care a pin how much he put down your
throat&mdash;no, nor the apothecary either. He pill-ed and potioned,
and emetic-ed, and blistered, and plastered, till you
were so transparent, that even John Mitchell (and he&#8217;s the
shortest-sighted being alive) could have seen through you. And
then he braced you up with Iron and Quinine, till your muscles
were like whip-cords, and your hair in a bristle of kinks.
He was human-like, too; he didn&#8217;t stalk in as if Napoleon and
the Duke of Wellington were boiled down to make his grandfather.
No; he&#8217;d just as lief sit down on a butter-firkin as
on a velvet lounge. He&#8217;d pick up Aunt Esther&#8217;s knitting-needles,
and talk to grandpa about Bunker Hill, and those teetotally
discomfrizzled, bragging British, and offer grandma a
pinch of snuff, and trot the baby, and stroke the cat, and go to
the closet and eat up the pickles and doughnuts, and make himself
useful generally. <em>He</em> didn&#8217;t have to stupefy his patients
with ether, so that they needn&#8217;t find out how clumsily he operated.
No, it was quite beautiful to see him take a man&#8217;s
head between his knees, and drag his double teeth out. He
didn&#8217;t write a prescription for molasses and water, in High
Dutch: he didn&#8217;t tell you that you were booked for the river
Styx, and he was the only M. D. in creation who could annihilate
the ferryman waiting to row you over. He didn&#8217;t drive
through the town with his horse and gig, at break-neck speed,
just as meeting was out, as if life and death were hanging on
his profitless chariot wheels: he didn&#8217;t stick up over his door&mdash;&ldquo;<em>at
home between nine and ten</em>,&rdquo; as if that consecrated hour
were <em>all</em> he could bestow upon a clamorous public, when he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_347" id="Page_347">[Pg 347]</a></span>
was angling in vain for a patient every hour in the twenty-four;
nor did he give little boys shillings to rush into church, and call
him out in the middle of the service. No: Dr. Jalap was not
a &ldquo;modern improvement.&rdquo;</p>

<h2>THE OLD MERCHANT WANTS A SITUATION.</h2>

<p class="quote">&ldquo;An elderly gentleman, formerly a well-known merchant, wishes a situation; he
will engage in any respectable employment not too laborious.&rdquo;&mdash;<em>New York Daily
Paper.</em></p>
<p class="new_para">I don&#8217;t know the old man. I never saw him on &#8217;change, in
a fine suit of broadcloth, leaning on his gold-headed cane; while
brokers, and insurance officers, and presidents of banks raised
their hats deferentially, and the crowd respectfully made way
for him. I never kept account of the enormous taxes he annually
paid the city, or saw his gallant ships ploughing the blue
ocean with their costly freight, to foreign ports. I never saw him
in his luxurious home, taking his quiet siesta, lulled by the
liquid voice of his fairy daughter. No: nor did I hear the auctioneer&#8217;s
hammer in that home, nor see the red flag floating,
like a signal of distress, before the door. I didn&#8217;t read the
letter that recalled his only boy from college, or see the humbled
family, as they passed, shrinking, over the threshold, into
poor lodgings, whose landlord coarsely stipulated for &ldquo;a week&#8217;s
rent in advance.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="new_para">&ldquo;Any occupation not <em>too laborious</em>.&rdquo; How mournfully the
old man&#8217;s words fall upon the ear! Life to commence anew,
with the silver head, and bent form, and faltering step, and pal<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_349" id="Page_349">[Pg 349]</a></span>sied
hand of age! With the first ray of morning light, that
hoary head must be lifted from an unquiet pillow, to encounter
the drenching rain, and driving sleet, and piercing cold.
No reprieve from that wearisome ledger, for the throbbing
brow and dimmed eye. Beardless clerks make a jest of &ldquo;the old
boy;&rdquo; superciliously repeating, in his sensitive ear, their mutual
master&#8217;s orders. With them he meekly receives his
weekly pittance; sighing, as he counts it over, to think of the
few comforts it will bring to the drooping hearts at home.
Foot-weary, he travels through the crowded streets; his threadbare
coat, and napless hat, and dejected face, all unnoticed by
the thriving young merchant, whom the old man helped to his
present prosperous business position. The birth-days of his
delicate daughter come and go, all unmarked by the joy-bestowing
gift. With trouble and exposure, sickness comes at
last: then, the tardy foot, and careless, professional touch of
the callous-hearted dispensary doctor: then, the poor man&#8217;s
hearse stands before the door; then winds unheeded through
busy streets, to the &ldquo;Potter&#8217;s field,&rdquo; while his former cotemporaries
take up the daily paper, and sipping their wine, say
carelessly, as if <em>they</em> had a quit-claim from sorrow, &ldquo;Well,
Old Smith, the broken-down millionaire, is dead.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="new_para">Ah, there are tragedies of which editors and printers little
dream, woven in their daily advertising sheets: the office boy
feeds the fire with many a tear-blotted manuscript, penned by
trembling fingers, all unused to toil.</p>

<h2>A MOVING TALE.</h2>

<p class="new_para">The Smiths have just been moving. They always move
&ldquo;for the last time,&rdquo; on the first of May. &ldquo;Horrid custom!&rdquo;
exclaims Smith, wiping the perspiration from his brow, and
pulling up his depressed dickey. &ldquo;How my blood curdles
and my bones ache, at the thought!&rdquo; It was on Tuesday, the
third of May, that the afflicting rite was celebrated. Cartmen&mdash;four
of them&mdash;were engaged the Saturday previous, to
be on hand at six o&#8217;clock on Tuesday morning, to transport
the household goods from the habitation of &#8217;52-3 to that of &#8217;53-4.
Smith was to pay them three dollars each&mdash;twelve dollars in
all. They would not come for a mill less; Smith tried them
thoroughly.</p>

<p class="new_para">On Monday, Smith&#8217;s house is turned into a sort of Bedlam,
minus the beds. They are tied up, ready for the next morning&#8217;s
Hegira; the Smiths sleeping on the floor on Monday night.
Smith can&#8217;t sleep on the floor; he grows restless; he receives
constant reminders from Mrs. Smith to take his elbow out of
the baby&#8217;s face; he has horrid visions and rolls about: therefore,
he is not at all surprised, on waking at cock-crow, to find
his head in the fire-place, and his hair powdered with soot. The
occasion of his waking at that time, was a dream of an un<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_351" id="Page_351">[Pg 351]</a></span>pleasant
nature. He dreamed that he had rolled off the world
backwards, and lodged in a thorn-bush. Of course, such a
thing was slightly improbable; but how could Smith be responsible
for a dream?</p>

<p class="new_para">On Tuesday morning, the Smiths are up with the dawn.
The household being mustered, it is found that the servant girl,
who had often averred that, &ldquo;she lived out, just for a little exercise,&rdquo;
had deserted her colors. The grocer on the corner politely
informs Smith, (whom Mrs. S. had sent on an errand of
inquiry) that, on the night previous, the servant left with him a
message for her employers, to the effect that &ldquo;she didn&#8217;t consider
moving the genteel thing, at all; and that a proper regard
for her character and position in society, had induced
her to get a situation in the family of a gentleman who owned
the house he lived in.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="new_para">This is severe: Smith feels it keenly; Mrs. Smith leans her
head against her husband&#8217;s vest pattern, and says &ldquo;She is
quite crushed,&rdquo; and &ldquo;wonders how Smith can have the heart
to whistle. But, it is always so,&rdquo; she remarks. &ldquo;Woman is
the weaker vessel, and man delights to trample on her.&rdquo;
Smith indignantly denies this sweeping assertion, and says
&ldquo;he tramples on nothing;&rdquo; when Mrs. Smith points to a bandbox
containing her best bonnet, which he has just put his foot
through. Smith is silent.</p>

<p class="new_para">The cartmen were to be on the premises at six o&#8217;clock. Six
o&#8217;clock comes&mdash;half-past six&mdash;seven o&#8217;clock&mdash;but no cartmen.
Here is a dilemma! The successors to the Smiths are
to be on the ground at eight o&#8217;clock; and being on the ground,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_352" id="Page_352">[Pg 352]</a></span>
they will naturally wish to get into the house; which they
cannot well do, unless the Smiths are out of it.</p>

<p class="new_para">Smith takes a survey of his furniture, with a feeling of intense
disgust. He wishes his cumbrous goods were reduced
to the capacity of a carpet-bag, which he could pick up and
walk away with. The mirrors and pianoforte are his especial
aversion. The latter is a fine instrument, with an Eolian attachment.
He wishes it had a sheriff&#8217;s attachment; in fact, he
would have been obliged to any officer who should, at that
wretched moment, have sold out the whole establishment,
at the most &ldquo;ruinous sacrifice,&rdquo; ever imagined by an auctioneer&#8217;s
fertile &ldquo;marvelousness.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="new_para">&mdash;Half-past seven, and no cartmen yet. What is to be
done? Ah! here they come, at last. Smith is at a loss to
know what excuse they will make. Verdant Smith! <em>They
make no excuse.</em> They simply tell him, with an air which
demands his congratulations, that they &ldquo;picked up a nice job
by the way, and stopped to do it. You see,&rdquo; says the principal,
&ldquo;we goes in for all we can get, these times, and there&#8217;s
no use of anybody&#8217;s grumbling. Kase, you see, if one don&#8217;t
want us, another will; and it&#8217;s no favor for anybody to employ
us a week either side the first of May.&rdquo; The rascal
grins, as he says this; and Smith, perceiving the strength of
the cartman&#8217;s position, wisely makes no reply.</p>

<div class="figcenter">

<p class="caption">&ldquo;They met, &#8217;twas in a crowd&rdquo;&mdash;<br />on the stairs, and Smith<br />&ldquo;Thought that Brown would shun him,&rdquo;<br />&mdash;but he didn&#8217;t!</p>

<p class="new_para">They begin to load. Just as they get fairly at work, the
Browns (the Smiths&#8217; successors) arrive, with an appalling display
of stock. Brown is a vulgar fellow, who has suddenly
become rich, and whose ideas of manliness all center in bru<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_353" id="Page_353">[Pg 353]</a></span>tality.
He is furious because the Smiths are not &ldquo;clean gone.&rdquo;
He &ldquo;can&#8217;t wait there, all day, in the street.&rdquo; He orders his
men to &ldquo;carry the things into the house,&rdquo; and heads the column
himself with a costly rocking-chair in his arms. As Brown
comes up with his rocking-chair, Smith, at the head of his men,
descends, with a bureau, from the second floor.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&ldquo;They met, &#8217;twas in a crowd&rdquo;&mdash;<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>on the stairs, and Smith</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&ldquo;Thought that Brown would shun him,&rdquo;<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>&mdash;but he didn&#8217;t! The consequence was, they came in collision;
or, rather, Smith&#8217;s bureau and Brown&#8217;s rocking-chair came
in collision. Now, said bureau was an old-fashioned, hardwood
affair, made for service, while Brown&#8217;s rocking-chair was
a flimsy, showy fabric, of modern make. The meeting on the
stairs occasions some squeezing, and more stumbling, and
Brown suddenly finds himself and chair under the bureau, to
the great injury of his person and his furniture. (Brown has
since recovered, but the case of the rocking-chair is considered
hopeless.) This discomfiture incenses the Browns to a high
degree, and they determine to be as annoying as possible; so
they persist in bringing their furniture into the house, and up
stairs, as the Smiths are carrying theirs out of the house, and
down stairs. Collisions are, of course, the order of the day;
but the Smiths do not mind this much, as they have a great
advantage, viz: <em>their furniture is not half so good as Brown&#8217;s</em>.
After a few smashes, Brown receives light on this point, and
orders his forces to remain quiet, while the foe evacuates the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_354" id="Page_354">[Pg 354]</a></span>
premises; so the Smiths retire in peace&mdash;and much of their
furniture in pieces.</p>

<p class="new_para">The four carts form quite a respectable procession; but
there is no disguising the fact that the furniture looks very
shabby (and whose furniture does not look shabby, piled on
carts?); so the Smiths prudently take a back street, that no
one may accuse them of owning it. Smith has to carry the
baby and a large mirror, which Mrs. S. was afraid to trust to
the cartmen, there being no insurance on either. It being a
windy day, both the mirror and Smith&#8217;s hat veer to all points
of the compass, while the baby grows very red in the face at
not being able to possess himself of them. Between the wind,
the mirror, his hat and the baby, Smith has an unpleasant
walk of it.</p>

<p class="new_para">About ten o&#8217;clock, they arrive at their new residence, and
find, to their horror, that their predecessors have not begun to
move. They inquire the reason. The feminine head of the
family informs them, with tears in her eyes, that her husband,
(Mr. Jonas Jenkins,) has been sick in Washington for five
weeks; that, in consequence of his affliction, they have not
been able to provide a new tenement; that she is quite unwell,
and that one of her children (she has six) is ill, also; that she
don&#8217;t know what is to become of them, &amp;c., &amp;c. Smith sets
his hat on the back of his head, gives a faint tug at his neck-tie
and confesses himself&mdash;quenched! His furniture looks more
odious every minute. He once felt much pride in it, but he
feels none now: he feels only disgust. The cartmen begin to
growl out that they &ldquo;can&#8217;t stand here all day,&rdquo; and request to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_355" id="Page_355">[Pg 355]</a></span>
be informed &ldquo;where we shall drop the big traps.&rdquo; Hereupon,
Smith ventures, with a ghastly attempt at a smile, to inquire
of Mrs. Jenkins why she didn&#8217;t tell him, when he called, on
Saturday, of her inability to procure a house? To which that
lady innocently replies that she didn&#8217;t wish to give him any
<span class="correction" title="Transcriber&apos;s Note: Quotation mark added.">&ldquo;unnecessary</span> trouble!&rdquo; which reply satisfies him as to Mrs. Jenkin&#8217;s
claim to force of intellect.</p>

<p class="new_para">At this juncture, Smith falls into a profound reverie. He
thinks that, after all, Fourier is right&mdash;&ldquo;that the Solidarity of
the human race is an entity;&rdquo; that &ldquo;nobody can be happy,
until everybody is happy.&rdquo; He agrees with the great philosopher,
that the &ldquo;series distributes the harmonies.&rdquo; He realizes
that &ldquo;society is organized (or, rather, disorganized) on a wrong
basis;&rdquo; that it is in an &ldquo;amorphous condition,&rdquo; whereas it should
be &ldquo;crystalized.&rdquo; With our celebrated &ldquo;down east&rdquo; poet,
Ethan Spike, Esq., he begins to think that,</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&ldquo;The etarnal bung is loose,&rdquo;<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>and that, unless it be soon tightened, there is danger that</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&ldquo;All nater will be <span class="correction" title="Transcriber&apos;s Note: Quotation mark added.">spilt.&rdquo;</span><br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>He comes to the conclusion, finally, that &ldquo;something must be
done,&rdquo; and that speedily, to &ldquo;secure a home for every family.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="new_para">At this point, he is aroused by his tormenters, the cartmen,
who inform him that they are in a &ldquo;Barkis&rdquo; state of mind,
(willin&#8217;) to receive their twelve dollars. Smith pays the money,
and turns to examine the premises. He finds that Mrs. Jenkins
has packed all her things in the back basement and the
second-floor sitting-room. Poor thing! she has done her best,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_356" id="Page_356">[Pg 356]</a></span>
after all. She is in ill health; her husband is sick, and away
from home; and her children are not well. God pity the unfortunate
who live in cities, especially in the &ldquo;moving season.&rdquo;
But Smith is a kind-hearted man. With a few exceptions, the
Smiths are a kind-hearted race&mdash;and that&#8217;s probably the reason
they are so numerous.</p>

<p class="new_para">Smith puts on a cheerful countenance, and busies himself in
<span class="correction"
title="Transcriber&apos;s Note: Originally &ldquo;arrranging&rdquo;">arranging</span> his furniture. Mrs. Smith, kind soul, forgets the
destruction of her bandbox and bonnet, and cares not how long
or how loud Smith whistles. Suddenly the prospect brightens!
Mrs. Jenkins&#8217; brother-in-law appears, and announces that
he has found rooms for her, a little higher up town. Cartmen
are soon at the door, and the Jenkinses are on their &ldquo;winding
way&rdquo; to their new residence.</p>

<p class="new_para">&mdash;But the Smiths&#8217; troubles are not yet over. The painters,
who were to have had the house all painted the day before,
have done nothing but leave their paint-pots in the hall, and a
little Smithling, being of an investigating turn of mind, and
hungry, withal, attempts to make a late breakfast off the contents
of one of them. He succeeds in eating enough to disgust
him with his bill of fare, and frighten his mamma into
hysterics. A doctor is sent for: he soon arrives, and, after
attending to the mother, gives the young adventurer a facetious
chuck under the chin, and pronounces him perfectly safe. The
parents are greatly relieved, for Willy is a pet; and they confidently
believe him destined to be President of the United
States, if they can only keep paint-pots out of his way.</p>

<p class="new_para">It takes the Smiths some ten days to get &ldquo;to rights.&rdquo; The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_357" id="Page_357">[Pg 357]</a></span>
particulars of their further annoyances&mdash;how the carpets
didn&#8217;t fit; how the cartmen &ldquo;lost the pieces;&rdquo; how the sofas
couldn&#8217;t be made to look natural; how the pianoforte was too
large to stand behind the parlor door, and too small to stand
between the front windows; how the ceiling was too low, and the
book-case too high; how a bottle of indelible ink got into the bureau
by mistake and &ldquo;marked&rdquo; all Mrs. Smith&#8217;s best dresses&mdash;I
forbear to inflict on the reader. Suffice it to say, the Smiths
are in &ldquo;a settled state;&rdquo; although their apartments give signs
of the recent manifestation of a strong disturbing force&mdash;reminding
one, somewhat, of a &ldquo;settlement&rdquo; slowly recovering
from the visitation of an earthquake. Still, they are thankful
for present peace, and are determined, <em>positively</em>, not to move
again&mdash;until next May.</p>

<p class="new_para">We gaze into the narrow cells, and draw a long breath.
Poor creatures, tempted and tried. How many to whom the
world now pays its homage, who sit in high places, <em>should</em> be
in their stead? God knoweth. See them, with their pale faces
pressed up against the grated windows, or pacing up and down
their stone floors, like chained beasts. There is a little boy

<p class="new_para">&ldquo;For murder?&rdquo; How sad! Ah! somewhere in the length

Death laughs at bolts and fetters, and many a poor wretch is
borne struggling within these gloomy walls, only to be carried
to his last home, while none but God may ever know at whose
fireside stands his vacant chair.</p>

<p class="new_para">And here is a woman&#8217;s cell. There are two or three faded
dresses hanging against the walls, and a bonnet, for which she
has little use. Her friends have brought her some bits of carpeting,
which she has spread over the stone floor, with her
womanly love of order, (poor thing,) to make the place look

kneels before it! May the Holy Virgin&#8217;s blessed Son, who
said to the sinning one, &ldquo;Neither do I condemn thee,&rdquo; send into
her stricken heart the balm of holy peace.</p>

<p class="new_para">Who is that? No! it <em>cannot</em> be&mdash;but, yes, it is he&mdash;and

platform, raised over the stone floor. It is for gutter drunkards&mdash;too
foul, too loathsome to be placed upon a bed&mdash;turned
in here like swine, to wallow in the same slough. Oh,
how few, who, festively sipping the rosy wine, say &ldquo;<em>my</em> mountain

<p class="new_para">Look there! tread softly: angels are near us. Through the
grated window the light streams faintly upon a little pallet,
where, sweet as a dream of heaven, lies a sleeping babe! Over
its cherub face a smile is flitting. The cell has no other occupant;
angels only watch the slumbers of the prison-cradled.
The place is holy. I stoop to kiss its forehead. From the
crowd of women pacing up and down the guarded gallery, one
glides gently to my side, saying, half proudly, half sadly, &ldquo;&#8217;Tis
<em>my</em> babe.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="new_para">&ldquo;It is <em>so</em> sweet, and pure, and holy,&rdquo; said I.</p>

<p class="new_para">The mother&#8217;s lip quivered; wiping away a tear with her
apron, she said, in a choking voice:</p>

<p class="new_para">&ldquo;Ah, it is little the likes of you, ma&#8217;am, know how hard it
is for us to get the honest bread!&rdquo;</p>

<p class="new_para">God be thanked, thought I, that there is one who &ldquo;judgeth
<em>not</em> as man judgeth;&rdquo; who holdeth evenly the scales of justice;
who weigheth against our sins the <em>whirlpool</em> of our temptations,
who forgetteth never the countless struggles for the victory, ere
the desponding, weary heart shuts out the light of Heaven.</p>

<h2>MRS. ZEBEDEE SMITH&#8217;S PHILOSOPHY.</h2>

<p class="new_para">Dear me! how expensive it is to be poor. Every time I
go out, my best bib and tucker has to go on. If Zebedee were
worth a cool million, I might wear a coal-hod on my head, if I
chose, with perfect impunity. There was that old nabob&#8217;s wife
at the lecture, the other night, in a dress that might have been
made for Noah&#8217;s great grandmother. She can afford it! Now,
if it rains knives and forks, I must sport a ten dollar hat, a forty
dollar dress, and a hundred dollar shawl. If I go to a concert,
I must take the highest priced seat, and ride there and back,
just to let &ldquo;Tom, Dick and Harry&rdquo; see that I can afford it.
Then, we must hire the most expensive pew in the broad-aisle
of a tip-top church, and give orders to the sexton not to admit
any strangers into it who look snobbish. Then my little children,
Napoleon Bonaparte and Donna Maria Smith, can&#8217;t go
to a public school, because, you know, we shouldn&#8217;t have to
pay anything.</p>

<p class="new_para">Then, if I go shopping, to buy a paper of needles, I have to
get a little chap to bring them home, because it wouldn&#8217;t answer
for me to be seen carrying a bundle through the streets.
We have to keep three servants, where one might do; and
Zebedee&#8217;s coats have to be sent to the tailor when they need a
button sewed on, for the look of the thing.</p>

<p class="new_para"><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_362" id="Page_362">[Pg 362]</a></span></p>

<p class="new_para">Then, if I go to the sea-shore, in summer, I can&#8217;t take my
comfort, as rich people do, in gingham dresses, loose shoes and
cambric sun-bonnets. No! I have to be done up by ten
o&#8217;clock in a Swiss-muslin dress, and a French cap; and my
Napoleon Bonaparte and Donna Maria can&#8217;t go off the piazza,
because the big rocks and little pebbles cut their toes so badly
through their patent kid slippers.</p>

<p class="new_para">Then, if Zebedee goes a fishing, he dare not put on a
linen coat, for the price of his reputation. No, indeed! Why,
he never goes to the barn-yard without drawing on his white
kids. Then he orders the most ruinous wines at dinner, and
fees those white jackets, till his purse is as empty as an egg-shell.
I declare, it is abominably expensive. I don&#8217;t believe
rich people have the least idea how much it costs poor people
to live!</p>

<h2>OPENING OF THE CRYSTAL PALACE.</h2>

<p class="new_para">Such a crowd, such a rush, such a confusion I never expect
to see again. Equestrians and pedestrians; omnibuses and
carriages; soldiers, civilians and <em>uncivil</em>-ians; carts and curricles;
city exquisites, and country nondescripts; men on the
run; women tiptoe-ing, with all sails spread; papas in a putter;
fat men sweltering; lean men, with tempers as sharp as
their bones, ruthlessly pushing through the crowd; musicians
perspiring in tuneful agony; thermometer evidently on a spree;
shirt-collars prostrate; dust everywhere; police nowhere; everybody
in somebody&#8217;s way;&mdash;whizz&mdash;buzz&mdash;rattle&mdash;bang&mdash;crash&mdash;smash;
&ldquo;Oh <em>dear</em>! where&#8217;s Pa?&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;Sarah Maria,
take care of your flounces.&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;Get out of the way, can&#8217;t
you?&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;Take your cane out of my eye, will you?&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;Mr.
Jones, just see the way that baby&#8217;s best bonnet is jammed!&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;Hurry!&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;I
<em>can&#8217;t</em> hurry; somebody has trod on my
skirt, and burst off the hooks; so much for not letting me wear
Bloomers! What a figure I cut, to appear before the President,
and no chance to apologize, Mr. Jones!&rdquo;</p>

<p class="new_para">&mdash;Well; it&#8217;s eleven o&#8217;clock, and after several abortive attempts,
we succeed in arresting an omnibus, labelled &ldquo;for the
Hippodrome and Crystal Palace.&rdquo; Away we go&mdash;dashing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_364" id="Page_364">[Pg 364]</a></span>
through the crowd, regardless of limbs, vehicular or human.
Broadway is lined, on either side, with a dense throng of
questionable looking expectants, waiting &ldquo;to see the procession.&rdquo;
Short people are at a discount; no chance for the poor
wretches, strain and tiptoe it as they will. One tall man, who
evidently knew the worth of his inches, seemed to think himself
too valuable to be let out all at once; so, he elevated himself,
jack-screw fashion, letting out one link of his vertebral column
after another, until he towered above his neighbors like a
pine tree among scrub oaks. What altitude he finally reached,
I am unable to say, as he was still on his way up (like Jack&#8217;s
bean-stalk) when our omnibus passed him.</p>

<p class="new_para">&ldquo;Everything comes in use once in seven years,&rdquo; says the old
proverb. I had often wondered of what earthly use could be
the tottering brick-piles, which disfigure every block in Broadway.
To-day, I was enlightened; they served admirably as
points of observation for the more adventurous spectators, and
each pile was covered with eager gazers. The windows overlooking
Broadway were all filled with neatly dressed ladies, and
as the eye swept through this magnificent thoroughfare, the rushing
vehicles, the swaying, motley multitudes, the gaily dressed
ladies, the waving flags and banners which floated over the more
public and prominent edifices, presented an ever varying panorama,
that was far from being the least attractive and impressive
feature of the day. I have often thought when the people
come out &ldquo;to see a sight,&rdquo; that they themselves are far more
imposing than what they came to see.</p>

<p class="new_para">On entering the Palace, we (my companion and I) found<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_365" id="Page_365">[Pg 365]</a></span>
that all the most eligible seats were already occupied, and that
what were left were reserved for some man of straw and his
wife. It was no use to show one&#8217;s ticket. &ldquo;You mustn&#8217;t sit
here!&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;You mustn&#8217;t sit there!&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;You can&#8217;t stand in
that place!&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;You can&#8217;t go there!&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;You can&#8217;t come
here!&rdquo;&mdash;and so the throng went forlornly about and around&mdash;old
men and maidens&mdash;heads of families&mdash;clergymen&mdash;elegant
ladies&mdash;all sorts of people&mdash;seeking places whereon they
might rest, and finding none. We finally resolved on action,
seized a couple of boxes of workmen&#8217;s tools, emptied the contents
on the floor, and converted the boxes into comfortable
seats, in the most commanding position in the eastern gallery,
notwithstanding the impertinent expostulations of the rosetted
officers.</p>

<p class="new_para">Above us was the lofty stained dome, a most imposing feature;&mdash;flags
of all nations waved from the latticed balconies;
beneath, the jeweled arms of ladies fair gleamed and flashed
in the sunlight. Directly below us was Marochetti&#8217;s equestrian
statue of Washington, of colossal proportions. Years ago, dear
general, you rode into my young affections on that very horse,
as represented on a ninepenny printed cotton handkerchief, given
me as a &ldquo;reward of merit&rdquo; for correctly &ldquo;declining to love&rdquo;&mdash;(I
wish I had always declined it!) In the immediate neighborhood,
our eye rested on a gigantic statue of Webster. There
were his features, certainly, all correct, by line and plummet;
but <em>where&#8217;s the expression</em>? It was soulless and corpse-like&mdash;it
failed to magnetize me.</p>

<p class="new_para">An hour has passed; our eyes are weary with gazing; still,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_366" id="Page_366">[Pg 366]</a></span>
no President. The singers have taken their places&mdash;the organ
has emitted one or two premonitory subterranean grumbles, and
the platform is beginning to fill with lesser dignitaries. The
richly-cushioned Presidential chair, has been wheeled about
in the most inviting locality; a huge bouquet is placed under
it by way of <em>bait</em>, but still the President doesn&#8217;t nibble!
So we bide our time with what patience we may&mdash;though the
thought of a glass of ice-water, or a cake, occasionally quenches
our patience and patriotism.</p>

<p class="new_para">Another hour has passed! Even feminine curiosity cannot
exist much longer on such unsubstantial aliment as pontifical
robes and empty glitter. My companion is certainly a wizard!
He has conjured up some ice cream and cake:&mdash;now I shall
have strength to cheer the President. Here he comes, God
bless him! You won&#8217;t see a sight like that out of America.
The representative of a mighty nation&mdash;one of the mightiest
on earth&mdash;receiving the homage of expectant thousands, standing
without &ldquo;star&rdquo; or &ldquo;order,&rdquo; or insignia of power, other than
that with which the Almighty has stamped him. No &ldquo;body
guard,&rdquo; no hedging him in from the people. It is sublime!</p>

<p class="new_para">&mdash;Now the Bishop reads an eloquent prayer; then follows
an ode, sung to the time-honored tune of <em>Old Hundred</em>, echoing
from hundreds of voices, through those deep naves, with
such thrilling majesty that you feel as if wings were growing
from out your shoulders, and you <em>must</em> soar; and suggesting
the song of the redeemed, sung by thousands and tens of thousands,
before the great White Throne.</p>

<p class="new_para">Now the speeches commence&mdash;but as I see a whole army<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_367" id="Page_367">[Pg 367]</a></span>
of reporters, down below, I shall use their ears instead of my
own, and make my escape while an omnibus is to be had.
Some day, when the President is not present to eclipse them, I
shall return and examine all the <em><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">chef de&#8217;oeuvres</span></em> of art here
collected.</p>

<p class="new_para">&mdash;Stay! here&#8217;s a pretty conceit I must look at, as we pass
along out&mdash;a mock garden of moss and flowers, about the size
of a lady&#8217;s work table, from the center of which plays a fountain
of eau de cologne, beneath whose drops any lady can perfume
her kerchief <em><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">en passant</span></em>, a dainty invention for a boudoir.
Need I say its birth-place is Paris.</p>

<p class="new_para">There&#8217;s the statue of the Amazonian Queen, startled by the
sudden spring of a tiger at her horse&#8217;s throat. Hartshorn and
smelling salts, <em>it&#8217;s alive</em>!&mdash;no; it is lifeless bronze, but so full
of vitality and expression, it makes me shiver to look at it.</p>

<p class="new_para">Now my eye is arrested by an imposing group of Thorwalsden,
&ldquo;Christ and his Apostles.&rdquo; It is not <em>my</em> Christ. It is
not He who said, &ldquo;Suffer little children to come unto me.&rdquo; It
is not He who said to the weeping Magdalen, &ldquo;Neither do I
condemn thee.&rdquo; It is not He who raised for the meek Mary,
the dead Lazarus. It is not He who, dying, cried, &ldquo;Father,
forgive them; they know not what they do.&rdquo; It is a form,
stern, unbending, forbidding. My heart refuses its allegiance.</p>

<p class="new_para">But I fear I am wearying the reader; so, let me close by
saying, that what astonished me more than anything else, was
the appearance of four of the most consummate <em>Knaves</em> in the
world. They occupied conspicuous positions during the public
exercises, and in fact, all the time I was there. Indeed, I am<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_368" id="Page_368">[Pg 368]</a></span>
informed that they have been in regular attendance ever since
the Palace was opened, notwithstanding they are well known,
not only to the police, but to the officers of the exhibition. It
is even whispered that the latter named gentlemen connive at
their attendance, unblushingly bestow many attentions upon
them, and will, undoubtedly, permit them to be present during
the entire exhibition. That the public may know and recognize
them, I will give their names: they are the North Nave,
the South Nave, the East Nave, and the West Nave!</p>

<h2>A LANCE COUCHED FOR THE CHILDREN.</h2>

<p class="new_para">You have a pretty, attractive child; she is warm-hearted and
affectionate, but vivacious and full of life. With judicious management,
and a firm, steady rein, she is a very lovable one.
You take her with you on a visit, or to make a call. You are
busy, talking with the friend you went to see. A gentleman
comes in and throws himself indolently on the sofa. His eye
falls upon little Kitty. He is just in the mood to be amused,
and makes up his mind to banter her a little, for the sake of
drawing her out. So he says&mdash;</p>

<p class="new_para">&ldquo;Jemima, dear&mdash;come here!&rdquo;</p>

<p class="new_para">The child blushes, and regards him as if uncertain whether
he intended to address her. He repeats his request, with a
laugh. She replies, &ldquo;my name is Kitty, not Jemima,&rdquo; which
her tormentor contradicts. Kitty looks puzzled, (just as he intended
she should,) but it is only for a moment. She sees he
is quizzing her. Well, Miss Kitty likes a frolic, if that is what
he wants; so she gives him a pert answer&mdash;he laughs uproariously,
and rattles fun round her little ears like a hail storm;
Kitty has plenty of answers ready for him, and he enjoys the
sport amazingly.</p>

<p class="new_para">By-and-by, he gets weary, and says,&mdash;&ldquo;There&mdash;run away<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_370" id="Page_370">[Pg 370]</a></span>
now, I&#8217;m going to read the newspaper;&rdquo; but Kitty is wide
awake, and has no idea of being cut short in that summary
way; so she continues her Lilliputian attacks, till finally he gets
up and beats a despairing retreat, muttering, &ldquo;what a very <em>disagreeable</em>
child.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="new_para">Mamma sees it all from a distance; she does not interfere&mdash;no&mdash;for
she believes in &ldquo;Children&#8217;s Rights.&rdquo; Kitty was
quiet, well behaved and respectful&mdash;till the visitor undertook
to quiz, and tease her, for his own amusement. He wanted a
frolic&mdash;and he has had it: <em>they who play with children must
take children&#8217;s play</em>.</p>

<h2>A CHAPTER ON HOUSEKEEPING.</h2>

<p class="new_para">I never could see the reason why your smart housekeepers
must, of necessity, be Xantippes. I once had the misfortune to
be domesticated during the summer months with one of this
genus.</p>

<p class="new_para">I should like to have seen the adventurous spider that would
have dared to ply his cunning trade in Mrs. Carrot&#8217;s premises!
Nobody was allowed to sleep a wink after daylight, beneath
her roof. Even her old rooster crowed one hour earlier than
any of her neighbors&#8217;. &ldquo;Go ahead,&rdquo; was written on every
broomstick in the establishment.</p>

<p class="new_para">She gave her husband his breakfast, buttoned up his overcoat,
and put him out of the front door, with his face in the direction
of the store, in less time than I&#8217;ve taken to tell it.
Then she snatched up the six little Carrots; scrubbed their
faces, up and down, without regard to feelings or noses, till
they shone like a row of milk pans.</p>

<p class="new_para">&ldquo;Clear the track&rdquo; was her motto, washing and ironing days.
She never drew a long breath till the wash-tubs were turned
bottom upwards again, and every article of wearing apparel
sprinkled, folded, ironed, and replaced on the backs of their
respective owners. It gave me a stitch in the side to look at
her!</p>

<p class="new_para"><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_372" id="Page_372">[Pg 372]</a></span></p>

<p class="new_para">As to her &ldquo;cleaning days,&rdquo; I never had courage to witness
one. I used to lie under an apple tree in the orchard, till she
was through. A whole platoon of soldiers wouldn&#8217;t have
frightened me so much as that virago and her mop.</p>

<p class="new_para">You should have seen her in her glory on &ldquo;baking days;&rdquo;
her sleeves rolled up to her arm-pits, and a long, check apron
swathed around her bolster-like figure. The great oven glowing,
blazing, and sparkling, in a manner very suggestive, to a
lazy sinner, like myself. The interminable rows of greased pie-plates;
the pans of rough and ready gingerbread; the pots of
pork and beans, in an edifying state of progression; and the
immense embryo loaves of brown and wheaten bread. To my
innocent inquiry, whether she thought the latter would &ldquo;rise,&rdquo;
she set her skinny arms akimbo, marched up within kissing
distance of my face, cocked her head on one side, and asked if
I thought she looked <span class="correction" title="Transcriber&apos;s Note: Quotation mark added.">&ldquo;like</span> a woman to be trifled with by a loaf
of bread!&rdquo; The way I settled down into my slippers, without
a reply, probably convinced her that I was no longer skeptical
on that point.</p>

<p class="new_para">Saturday evening she employed in winding up everything
that was unwound in the house&mdash;the old entry clock included.
From that time till Monday morning, she devoted to her husband
and Sabbatical exercises. All I have to say is, it is to be
hoped she carried some of the fervor of her secular employments
into those halcyon hours.</p>

<h2>BARNUM&#8217;S MUSEUM.</h2>

<p class="new_para">It is possible that every stranger may suppose, as I did, on
first approaching Barnum&#8217;s Museum, that the greater part of
its curiosities are on the outside, and have some fears that its
internal will not equal its external appearance. But, after crossing
the threshold, he will soon discover his mistake. The first
idea suggested will perhaps be that the view, from the windows,
of the motley, moving throng in Broadway&mdash;the rattling,
thundering carts, carriages and omnibuses&mdash;the confluence of
the vehicular and human tides which, from so many quarters,
come pouring past the museum&mdash;is, (to adopt the language of
advertisements,) &ldquo;worth double the price of admission.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="new_para">The visitor&#8217;s attention will unquestionably be next arrested
by the &ldquo;Bearded Lady of Switzerland&rdquo;&mdash;one of the most
curious curiosities ever presented. A card, in pleasant juxtaposition
to the &ldquo;lady,&rdquo; conveys the gratifying intelligence that,
&ldquo;Visitors are allowed to touch the beard.&rdquo; Not a man in the
throng lifts an investigating finger! Your penetration, Madame
Clofullia, does you infinite credit. You knew well enough that
your permission would be as good as a handcuff to every pair
of masculine wrists in the company. For my own part, I
should no more meddle with your beard, than with Mons. Clo<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_374" id="Page_374">[Pg 374]</a></span>fullia&#8217;s. I see no feminity in it. Its shoe-brush aspect puts
me on my decorum. I am glad you raised it, however, just to
show Barnum that there is something &ldquo;new under the sun,&rdquo;
and to convince men in general that a woman can accomplish
about anything she undertakes.</p>

<p class="new_para">I have not come to New York to stifle my inquisitiveness.
How did you raise that beard? Who shaves first in the morning?
you, or your husband? Do you use a Woman&#8217;s Rights
razor? Which of you does the <em>strap</em>-ping? How does your
baby know you from its father? What do you think of us,
smooth-faced sisters? Do you (between you and me) prefer
to patronize dress-makers, or tailors? Do you sing tenor, or
alto? Are you master, or mistress of your husband&#8217;s affections?&mdash;Well,
at all events, it has been something in your neutral
pocket to have &ldquo;tarried at Jericho till your beard was
grown.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="new_para">&mdash;What have we here? Canova&#8217;s Venus. She is exquisitely
beautiful, standing there, in her sculptured graces; but
where&#8217;s the Apollo? Ah, here&#8217;s a sleeping Cupid, which is
better. Mischievous little imp! I&#8217;m off before you wake!&mdash;Come
we now to a petrifaction of a horse and his rider, crushed
in the prehensile embrace of a monstrous serpent, found in a
cave where it must have lain for ages, and upon which one&#8217;s
imagination might pleasantly dwell for hours.&mdash;Then, here are
deputations from China-dom, in the shape of Mandarins, ladies
of quality, servants, priests, &amp;c., with their chalky complexions,
huckleberry eyes and shaven polls. Here, also, is a Chinese
criminal, packed into a barrel, with a hole in the lid, from which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_375" id="Page_375">[Pg 375]</a></span>
his head protrudes, and two at the sides, from whence his helpless
paws depend. Poor Min Yung, you ought to reflect on
the error of your ways, though, I confess, you&#8217;ve not much
chance to <em>room</em>-inate.</p>

<p class="new_para">Here are snakes, insects, and reptiles of every description,
corked down and pinned up, as all such gentry should be,&mdash;most
of them, I perceive, labeled in the masculine gender! Then
there&#8217;s a &ldquo;bear,&rdquo; the thought of whose hug makes me utter an
involuntary <em><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">pater noster</span></em>, and cling closer to the arm of my
guide. I tell you what, old Bruin, as I hope to travel, I trust
you&#8217;ve left none of your cubs behind.</p>

<p class="new_para">&mdash;Here is a group of Suliote chiefs, and in their midst Lord
Byron, with his shirt upside down; and here is the veritable
carriage that little Victoria used to ride in, before the crown of
royalty fretted her fair, girlish temples. Poor little embryo
queen! How many times since, do you suppose, she has longed
to step out of those bejeweled robes, drop the burdens state
imposes, and throw her weary limbs, with a child&#8217;s careless
<em>abandon</em>, on those silken cushions, free to laugh or cry, to sing
or sigh.</p>

<p class="new_para">&mdash;Then, here&#8217;s a collection of stuffed birds, whose rainbow
plumage has darted through clustering foliage, fostered in other
latitudes than ours. Nearly every species of beings that crawl,
or fly, or walk, or swim, is here represented. And what hideous
monsters some of them are! A &ldquo;pretty kettle of fish,&rdquo;
some of the representatives of the finny tribe would make! I
once thought I would like to be buried in the ocean, but I discarded
that idea before I had been in the museum an hour. I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_376" id="Page_376">[Pg 376]</a></span>
shouldn&#8217;t want such a &ldquo;scaly set&rdquo; of creatures swimming in
the same pond with me.</p>

<p class="new_para">&mdash;I had nearly forgotten to mention the &ldquo;Happy Family.&rdquo;
Here are animals and birds which are the natural prey of each
other, living together in such pleasant harmony as would make
a quarrelsome person blush to look upon. A sleek rat, probably
overcome by the oppressive weather, was gently dozing&mdash;a
cat&#8217;s neck supporting his sleepy head in a most pillow-ly manner.
Mutual vows of friendship had evidently been exchanged
and rat-ified by these natural enemies. I have not time to mention
in detail the many striking instances of fraternization among
creatures which have been considered each other&#8217;s irreconcilable
foes. Suffice it to say that Barnum and Noah are the only men
on record who have brought about such a state of harmonic
antagonisms, and that Barnum is the only man who has ever
made money by the operation.</p>

<p class="new_para">&mdash;Heigho! time fails us to explore all the natural wonders
gathered here, from all climes, and lands, and seas, by the enterprise
of perhaps the only man who could have compassed
it. We turn away, leaving the greater portion unexamined,
with an indistinct remembrance of what we have seen, but with
a most distinct impression that the &ldquo;getting up&rdquo; of Creation
was no ordinary affair, and wondering how it could ever have
been done in six days.</p>

<h2>A FERN REVERIE.</h2>

<p class="new_para">Dear me, I must go shopping. Shopping is a nuisance:
clerks are impertinent: feminity is victimized. Miserable day,
too: mud plastered an inch thick on the side walk. Well, if
we drop our skirts, gentlemen cry &ldquo;Ugh!&rdquo; and if we lift them
from the mud, they level their eye-glasses at our ankles. The
true definition of a gentleman (not found in incomplete Webster)
is&mdash;a biped, who, of a muddy day, is perfectly oblivious
of anything but the shop signs.</p>

<p class="new_para"><em><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Vive la France</span>!</em> Ingenious Parisians, send us over your

possession of the detestable little sham bonnets, which the milliners
persist in hanging on the backs of our necks.</p>

<p class="new_para">Well, here we are at Call &amp; Ketchum&#8217;s dry-goods store.

<p class="new_para">&ldquo;So am I.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="new_para">Dear me, how tired my feet are! nevertheless, I must have
some merino. So I open the door of Mr. Henry Humbug&#8217;s
dry-goods store, which is about half a mile in length, and inquire
for the desired article. Young Yardstick directs me to
the counter, at the <em>extreme</em> end of the store. I commence my
travels thitherward through a file of gaping clerks, and arrive
there just ten minutes before two, by my repeater; when I am
told &ldquo;they are quite out of merinos; but won&#8217;t Lyonnese cloth
do just as well?&rdquo; pulling down a pile of the same. I rush out
in a high state of frenzy, and, taking refuge in the next-door
neighbor&#8217;s, inquire for some stockings. Whereupon the clerk
inquires (of the wrong customer,) &ldquo;What price I wish to pay?&rdquo;
Of course, I am not so verdant as to be caught in that trap;
and, teetotally disgusted with the entire institution of shopping,
I drag my weary limbs into Taylor&#8217;s new saloon, to rest.</p>

<p class="new_para">Bless me! what a display of gilding, and girls, and gingerbread!
what a heap of mirrors! There&#8217;s more than one Fanny

their cheeks flush, and just hear their emancipated little tongues
go. Wonder if their husbands know that they&mdash;but of course
they don&#8217;t. However, it is six of one and half a dozen of the

eating oysters, at Florence&#8217;s; and their poor hungry children

<h2>APOLLO HYACINTH.</h2>

<p class="quote">&ldquo;There is no better test of moral excellence, than the keenness of one&#8217;s sense, and
the depth of one&#8217;s love, of all that is beautiful.&rdquo;&mdash;<em>Donohue.</em></p>
<p class="new_para">I don&#8217;t endorse that sentiment. I am acquainted with Apollo
Hyacinth. I have read his prose, and I have read his poetry;
and I have cried over both, till my heart was as soft as my
head, and my eyes were as red as a rabbit&#8217;s. I have listened
to him in public, when he was, by turns, witty, sparkling, satirical,
pathetic, till I could have added a codicil to my will,
and left him all my worldly possessions; and possibly you
have done the same. He has, perhaps, grasped you cordially
by the hand, and, with a beaming smile, urged you, in his musical
voice, to &ldquo;call on him and Mrs. Hyacinth;&rdquo; and you
have called: but, did you ever find him &ldquo;in?&rdquo; You have invited
him to visit you, and have received a &ldquo;gratified acceptance,&rdquo;
in his elegant chirography; but, <em>did he ever come</em>? He
has borrowed money of you, in the most elegant manner possible;
and, as he deposited it in his beautiful purse, he has assured
you, in the choicest and most happily chosen language,
that he &ldquo;should never forget your kindness;&rdquo; but, <em>did he ever
pay</em>?</p>

<p class="new_para">Should you die to-morrow, Apollo would write a poetical<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_382" id="Page_382">[Pg 382]</a></span>
obituary notice of you, which would raise the price of pocket-handkerchiefs;
but should your widow call on him in the
course of a month, to solicit his patronage to open a school, she
would be told &ldquo;he was out of town,&rdquo; and that it was &ldquo;quite
uncertain when he would return.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="new_para">Apollo has a large circle of relatives; but his &ldquo;keenness of
perception, and deep love, of the beautiful&rdquo; are so great, that
none of them <em>exactly</em> meet his views. His &ldquo;moral excellence,&rdquo;
however, does not prevent his making the most of them. He
has a way of dodging them adroitly, when they call for a reciprocation,
either in a business or a social way; or, if, at any
time, there is a necessity for inviting them to his house, he does
it when he is at his <em>country</em> residence, where their <em>greenness</em>
will not be out of place.</p>

<p class="new_para">Apollo never says an uncivil thing&mdash;never; he prides himself
on that, as well as on his perfect knowledge of human nature;
therefore, his sins are all sins of omission. His tastes are
very exquisite, and his nature peculiarly sensitive; consequently,
he cannot bear trouble. He will tell you, in his elegant
way, that trouble &ldquo;annoys&rdquo; him, that it &ldquo;bores&rdquo; him; in short,
that it unfits him for life&mdash;for business; so, should you hear
that a friend or relative of his, even a brother or a sister, was
in distress, or persecuted in any manner, you could not do
Apollo a greater injury (in his estimation) than to inform him
of the fact. It would so grate upon his sensitive spirit,&mdash;it
would so &ldquo;annoy&rdquo; him; whereas, did he not hear of it until
the friend, or brother, or sister, were relieved or buried, he
could manage the matter with his usual urbanity and without<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_383" id="Page_383">[Pg 383]</a></span>
the slightest draught upon his exquisitely sensitive nature, by
simply writing a pathetic and elegant note, expressing the keenest
regret at not having known &ldquo;all about it&rdquo; in time to have
&ldquo;flown to the assistance of his dear&rdquo;&mdash;&mdash;&amp;c.</p>

<p class="new_para">Apollo prefers friends who can stand grief and annoyance, as
a rhinoceros can stand flies&mdash;friends who can bear their own
troubles and all his&mdash;friends who will stand between him and
everything disagreeable in life, and never ask anything in return.
To such friends he clings with the most touching tenacity&mdash;as
long as he can use them; but let their good name be
assailed, let misfortune once overtake them, and his &ldquo;moral
excellence&rdquo; compels him, at once, to ignore their existence,
until they have been extricated from all their troubles, and it
has become perfectly safe and <em>advantageous</em> for him to renew
the acquaintance.</p>

<p class="new_para">Apollo is keenly alive to the advantages of social position,
(not having always enjoyed them;) and so, his Litany reads
after this wise: From all questionable, unfashionable, unpresentable,
and vulgar persons, Good Lord, deliver us!</p>

<h2>INCIDENT AT THE FIVE POINTS HOUSE OF INDUSTRY.</h2>

<p class="new_para">To be able to appreciate Mr. Pease&#8217;s toils, and sacrifices,
and self-denying labors at the Five Points House of Industry,
one must visit the locality:&mdash;one must wind through
those dirty streets and alleys, and see the wrecks of humanity
that meet him at every step;&mdash;he must see children
so dirty and squalid that they scarcely resemble human beings,
playing in filthy gutters, and using language that would curdle
his blood to hear from <em>childhood&#8217;s</em> lips;&mdash;he should see men,
&ldquo;made in God&#8217;s own image,&rdquo; brutalised beyond his power to
imagine;&mdash;he should see women (girls of not more than twenty
years) reeling about the pavements in a state of beastly intoxication,
without a trace of feminity in their vicious faces;&mdash;he
should pass the rum shops, where men and women are quarreling
and fighting and swearing, while childhood listens and
<em>learns</em>!&mdash;he should pass the second-hand clothes cellars, where
hard-featured Jewish dealers swing out faded, refuse garments,
(pawned by starving virtue for bread,) to sell to the needy,
half-naked emigrant for his last penny;&mdash;he should see decayed
fruit and vegetables which the most ravenous swine might well<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_389" id="Page_389">[Pg 389]</a></span>
root twice over before devouring, purchased as daily food by
these poor creatures;&mdash;he should see <em>gentlemen</em> (?) threading
these streets, not to make all this misery less, God knows, but to
sever the last thread of hope to which many a tempted one is
despairingly clinging.</p>

<p class="new_para">One must see all this, before he can form a just idea of the
magnitude and importance of the work that Mr. Pease has single-handed
and nobly undertaken; remembering that men of
wealth and influence have their own reasons for using that
wealth and influence to perpetuate this modern Sodom.</p>

<p class="new_para">One should spend an hour in Mr. Pease&#8217;s house, to see the
constant drafts upon his time and strength, in the shape of calls
and messages, and especially the applications for relief that <em>his</em>
slender purse alas! is often not able to answer;&mdash;he should
see his unwearied patience and activity, admire the kind, sympathetic
heart&mdash;unaffected by the toil or the frowns of temporizing
theorists&mdash;ever warm, ever pitiful, giving not only &ldquo;the
<em>crumbs</em> from his table,&rdquo; but often his own meals to the
hungry&mdash;his own wardrobe to the naked;&mdash;he should see
<em>this</em>, and go away <em>ashamed</em> to have lived so long and done so
little to help the maimed, and sick, and lame, to Bethesda&#8217;s
Pool.</p>

<p class="new_para">I will relate an incident which occurred, some time since, at
the House of Industry, and which serves as a fair sample of
daily occurrences there.</p>

<p class="new_para">One morning an aged lady, of respectable appearance, called
at the Mission House and enquired for Mr. Pease. She was
told that he was engaged, and asked if some one else would not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_390" id="Page_390">[Pg 390]</a></span>
do as well. She said, respectfully, &ldquo;No; my business is with
him; I will wait, if you please, till he can see me.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="new_para">Mr. Pease immediately came in, when the old lady commenced
her story:</p>

<p class="new_para">&ldquo;I came, sir,&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;in behalf of a poor, unfortunate
woman and three little children. She is living now&rdquo;&mdash;and
the tears dropped over her wrinkled face&mdash;&ldquo;in a bad place in
Willet-street, in a basement. There are rum shops all around
it, and many drunken people about the neighborhood. She
has made out to pay the rent, but has had no food for the poor
little children, who have subsisted on what they could manage
to beg in the day time. The landlord promised, when she
hired the basement, to put a lock on the door, and make it
comfortable, so that &lsquo;the Croton&rsquo; need not run in; but he
got his rent and then broke his promise, and they have not seen
him since.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="new_para">&ldquo;Is the woman respectable?&rdquo; enquired Mr. Pease.</p>

<p class="new_para">&ldquo;Yes&mdash;no&mdash;not exactly,&rdquo; said the poor old lady, violently
agitated. &ldquo;She was well brought up. She has a good heart,
sir, but a bad head, and then trouble has discouraged her.
Poor Mary&mdash;yes sir, it <em>must</em> have been the <em>trouble</em>&mdash;for I
know her <em>heart</em> is good, sir. I&rdquo;&mdash;tears choked the old lady&#8217;s
utterance. Recovering herself; she continued:</p>

<p class="new_para">&ldquo;She had a kind husband once. He was the father of her two
little girls: six years ago he died, and&mdash;the poor thing&mdash;oh,
sir, you don&#8217;t know how dear she is to <em>me</em>!&rdquo; and burying her
aged face in her hands, she sobbed aloud.</p>

<p class="new_para">Mr. Pease&#8217;s kind heart interpreted the old lady&#8217;s emotion,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_391" id="Page_391">[Pg 391]</a></span>
without the pain of an explanation. In the weeping woman before
him he saw the <em>mother</em> of the lost one.</p>

<p class="new_para">Yes, she was &ldquo;Mary&#8217;s&rdquo; mother. Poverty could not chill
her love; shame and the world&#8217;s scorn had only filled her
with a God-like pity.</p>

<p class="new_para">After a brief pause, she brushed away her tears and went on:</p>

<p class="new_para">&ldquo;Yes, sir; Mary was a good child to me <em>once</em>; she respected
religion and religious people, and used to love to go to
church, but lately, sir, God knows she has almost broke my
heart. Last spring I took her home, and the three dear children;
but she would not listen to me, and left without telling
me where she was going. I heard that there was a poor
woman living in a basement in Willet street, with three children,
and my heart told me that that was my poor, lost Mary,
and there I found her. But, oh, sir&mdash;oh, sir&rdquo;&mdash;and she sobbed
as if her heart were breaking&mdash;&ldquo;<em>such</em> a place! <em>My</em> Mary,
that I used to cradle in these arms to sleep, that lisped her little
evening prayer at <em>my</em> knee&mdash;<em>my</em> Mary, <em>drunk</em> in that terrible
place!&rdquo;</p>

<p class="new_para">She was getting so agitated that Mr. Pease, wishing to turn
the current of her thoughts, asked her if she herself was a
member of any church. She said yes, of the &mdash;&mdash; street
Baptist Church. She said she was a widow, and had had one
child beside Mary&mdash;a son. And her face lighted up as she
said:</p>

<p class="new_para">&ldquo;Oh sir, he was such a <em>fine</em> lad. He did all he could to
make me happy; but he thought, that if he went to California
he could make money, and when he left he said &lsquo;Cheer up, dear<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_392" id="Page_392">[Pg 392]</a></span>
mother; I&#8217;ll come back and give my money all to <em>you</em>, and
you shall never work any more.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

<p class="new_para">&ldquo;I can see him now, sir, as he stood there, with his eye kindling.
Poor lad! poor lad! He came back, but it was only
to die. His last words were, &lsquo;God will care for you, mother&mdash;I
know it&mdash;when I&#8217;m gone to Heaven.&rsquo; Oh! if I could have
seen my poor <em>girl</em> die as he did, before she became so bad.
Oh, sir, <em>won&#8217;t</em> you take her <em>here</em>?&mdash;<em>won&#8217;t</em> you try to make her
good?&mdash;<em>can&#8217;t</em> you make her good, sir? I <em>can&#8217;t</em> give Mary up.
Nobody cares for Mary now but me. Won&#8217;t you try, sir?&rdquo;</p>

<p class="new_para">Mr. Pease promised that he would do all he could, and sent
a person out with the old lady, to visit &ldquo;Mary,&rdquo; and obtain
particulars: he soon returned and corroborated all the old lady&#8217;s
statements. Mr. Pease then took a friend and started to
see what could be done.</p>

<p class="new_para">In Willet street is a rickety old wooden building, filled to
overflowing with the very refuse of humanity. The basement
is lighted with two small windows half under ground; and in
this wretched hole lived Mary and her children. As Mr. Pease
descended the steps into the room, he heard some one say,
&ldquo;Here he comes, grandmother! he&#8217;s come&mdash;he&#8217;s come!&rdquo;</p>

<p class="new_para">The door was opened. On a pile of rags in the corner lay
Mary, &ldquo;my Mary,&rdquo; as the old lady tearfully called her.</p>

<p class="new_para">God of mercy! what a wreck of beautiful womanhood!
Her large blue eyes glared with maniac wildness, under the influence
of intoxication. Long waves of auburn hair fell, in tangled
masses, over a form wasted, yet beautiful in its graceful
outlines.</p>

<p class="new_para"><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_393" id="Page_393">[Pg 393]</a></span></p>

<p class="new_para">Poor, lost Mary!</p>

<p class="new_para">&ldquo;<em>Such</em> a place!&rdquo; as her mother had, weeping, said. Not a
table, or chair, or bedstead, or article of furniture in it, of any
description. On the mantle-piece stood a beer-bottle with a
half burnt candle in its nose. A few broken, dirty dishes stood
upon the shelf, and a quantity of filthy rags lay scattered
round the floor.</p>

<p class="new_para">The grandmother was holding by the hand a sweet child of
eight years, with large, bright eyes, and auburn hair (like poor
Mary&#8217;s) falling about her neck. An older girl of twelve, with
a sweet, Madonna face, that seemed to light up even <em>that</em>
wretched place with a beam of Heaven, stood near, bearing in
her arms a babe of sixteen months, which was not so large as
one of eight months should have been. Its little hands looked
like bird&#8217;s claws, and its little bones seemed almost piercing
the skin.</p>

<p class="new_para">The old lady went up to her daughter, saying, &ldquo;Mary, dear,
this is the gentleman who is willing to take you to his house, if
you will try to be good.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="new_para">&ldquo;Get out of the room, you old hypocrite,&rdquo; snarled the intoxicated
woman, &ldquo;or I&#8217;ll&mdash;&mdash;(and she clutched a hatchet
beside her)&mdash;I&#8217;ll show you! You are the worst old woman
I ever knew, except the one you brought in here the other day,
and she is a fiend outright. Talk to <em>me</em> about being <em>good</em>!&mdash;ha&mdash;ha&rdquo;&mdash;and
she laughed an idiot laugh.</p>

<p class="new_para">&ldquo;Mother,&rdquo; said the eldest child, sweetly laying her little hand
upon her arm,&mdash;&ldquo;<em>dear</em> mother, don&#8217;t, please don&#8217;t hurt grand<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_394" id="Page_394">[Pg 394]</a></span>mother.
She is good and kind to us; she only wants to get
you out of this bad place, where you will be treated kindly.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="new_para">&ldquo;Yes, dear <span class="correction" title="Transcriber&apos;s Note: Quotation mark added.">mother,&rdquo;</span> chimed in the younger sister, bending
her little curly head over her, &ldquo;mother, you said once you
<em>would</em> go. Don&#8217;t keep us here any longer, mother. We are
cold and hungry. Please get up and take us away; we are
afraid to stay here, mother, dear.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="new_para">&ldquo;Yes, Mary,&rdquo; said the old lady, handing her down a faded,
ragged gown, &ldquo;here is your dress; put it on, wont you!&rdquo;</p>

<p class="new_para">Mary raised herself on the pile of rags on which she was lying,
and pushing the eldest girl across the room, screamed out,
&ldquo;Get away, you impudent little thing! you are just like your
old grandmother. I tell you <em>all</em>,&rdquo; said she, raising herself on
one elbow, and tossing back her auburn hair from her broad,
white forehead, &ldquo;I tell you all, I <em>never</em> will go from here, <em>never</em>!
I <em>love</em> this place. So many fine people come here, and we have
such good times. There is a gentleman who takes care of me.
He brought me some candles, last night, and he says that I
shan&#8217;t want for anything, if I will only get rid of these troublesome
children&mdash;<em>my husband&#8217;s</em> children.&rdquo; And she hid her
face in her hands and laughed convulsively.</p>

<p class="new_para">&ldquo;You may have <em>them</em>,&rdquo; she continued, &ldquo;just as soon as you
like&mdash;baby and all! but I never will go from this place. I
<em>love</em> it. A great many fine people come here to see me.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="new_para">The poor old lady wrung her hands and wept, while the children
clung round their grandmother, with half-averted faces,
trembling and silent.</p>

<p class="new_para">Mr. Pease said to her, &ldquo;Mary, you may either go with me,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_395" id="Page_395">[Pg 395]</a></span>
or I&#8217;ll send for an officer and have you carried to the station-house.
Which will you do?&rdquo;</p>

<p class="new_para">Mary cursed and raved, but finally put on the dress the old
lady handed her, and consented to go with them. A carriage
was soon procured, and Mary helped inside&mdash;Mr. Pease lifting
in the baby and the two little girls, and away they started
for the Five Points House of Industry.</p>

<p class="new_para">&ldquo;Oh, mother!&rdquo; exclaimed the younger of the girls, &ldquo;how
very pleasant it is to ride in this nice carriage, and to get away
from that dirty place; we shall be so happy now, mother; and
Edith and the baby too: see, he is laughing: he likes to ride.
You will love sister Edith and baby, and me, <em>now</em>, wont you,
dear mother? and you wont frighten us with the hatchet any
more, or hurt dear grandmother, will you?&rdquo;</p>

<p class="new_para">Arriving at Mr. Pease&#8217;s house, the delight of the little creatures
was unbounded. They caught hold of their mother&#8217;s faded
dress, saying, &ldquo;Didn&#8217;t we <em>tell</em> you, mother, that you would
have a pleasant home here? Only see that nice garden! you
didn&#8217;t have a garden in Willet Street, mother!&rdquo;</p>

<p class="new_para">Reader, would you know that mother&#8217;s after history?</p>

<p class="new_para">Another &ldquo;Mary&rdquo; hath &ldquo;bathed the Saviour&#8217;s feet&rdquo; with her
tears, and wiped them with the hairs of her head. Her name
is no longer written Mary <em>Magdalena</em>. In the virtuous home
of her aged mother, she sits clothed in her right mind, &ldquo;and
her children rise up and call her <em>blessed</em>.&rdquo;</p>

<h2>NANCY PRY&#8217;S SOLILOQUY.</h2>

<p class="new_para">I wonder if that is the bride, over at that window? Poor
thing, how I pity her! Every thing in her house so bran new
and fresh and uncomfortable. Furniture smelling like a mahogany
coffin; every thing set up spick and span in its place;
not a picture awry; not a chair out of its orbit; not a finger
mark on the window panes; not a thread on the carpet; not a
curtain fold disarranged; china and porcelain set up in alphabetical
order in the pantry; bureau drawers fit for a Quaker;
no stockings, to mend; no strings or buttons missing; no old
rag-bags to hunt over; no dresses to re-flounce, or re-tuck, or
re-fashionize; not even a hook or eye absent. Sauce pans, pots,
and kettles, fresh from the &ldquo;furnishing house;&rdquo; servants fresh;
house as still as a cat-cornered mouse. Nothing stirring, nothing
to do. Land of Canaan! I should think it would be a relief to
her to hear the braying and roaring in Driesbach&#8217;s Menagerie.</p>

<p class="new_para">Well, there&#8217;s one consolation; in all human probability, it is
a state of things that won&#8217;t last long.</p>

<h2>FOR LITTLE CHILDREN.</h2>

<p class="quote">&ldquo;I love God and every little child.&rdquo;&mdash;<em>Richter.</em></p>

<p class="new_para">I wonder if I have any little pinafore friends among the
readers of <em>Fern Leaves</em>? any little Nellys, or Katys, or Billys,
or Johnnys, who ever think of Fanny? Do you know that I
like children much better than grown-up people? I should so
like to have a whole lap full of your bright eyes, and rosy
cheeks, and dimpled shoulders, to kiss. I should like to have
a good romp with you, this very minute. I don&#8217;t always keep
this old pen of mine scratching. If a bright cloud comes sailing
past my window, I throw down my pen, toss up the casement,
and drink in the air, like a gipsey. I feel just as you do,
when you are pent up in school, some bright summer day,
when the winds are at play, and the flowers lie languidly drooping
under the blue, arching sky;&mdash;when the little butterfly
poises his bright wings on the rose, too full of joy even to sip
its sweets;&mdash;when the birds sing, because they can&#8217;t help it, and
the merry little swallow skims the ground, dips his bright wing
in the lake, circles over head, and then flies, twittering, back to
his cunning little brown nest, under the eaves. On such a
day, <em>I</em> should like to be your school-mistress. I&#8217;d throw open
the old school-room door, and let you all out under the trees.
You should count the blades of grass for a sum in addition;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_398" id="Page_398">[Pg 398]</a></span>
you should take an apple from a tree, to learn subtraction;
you should give me kisses, to learn multiplication. You shouldn&#8217;t
go home to dinner. No: we&#8217;d all take our dinner-baskets and
go into the woods; we&#8217;d hunt for violets; we&#8217;d lie on the moss
under the trees, and look up at the bits of blue sky, through
the leafy branches; we&#8217;d hush our breath when the little chipmunk
peeped out of his hole, and watch him slily snatch the
ripe nut for his winter&#8217;s store. And we&#8217;d look for the shy rabbit;
and the little spotted toad, with its blinking eyes; and the
gliding snake, which creeps out to sun itself on the old gray
rock. We&#8217;d play hide and seek, in the hollow trunks of old
trees; we&#8217;d turn away from the gaudy flowers, flaunting their
showy beauty in our faces, and search, under the glossy leaves
at our feet, for the pale-eyed blossoms which nestle there as
lovingly as a timid little fledgling under the mother-bird&#8217;s wing;
we&#8217;d go to the lake, and see the sober, staid old cows stand
cooling their legs in the water, and admiring themselves in the
broad, sheeted mirror beneath; we&#8217;d toss little pebbles in the
lake, and see the circles they made, widen and widen toward
the distant shore&mdash;like careless words, dropped and forgotten,
but reaching to the far-off shore of eternity.</p>

<p class="new_para">And then you should nestle &#8217;round me, telling all your little
griefs; for well I know that childhood has its griefs, which
are all the keener because great, wise, grown-up people have
often neither time nor patience, amid the bustling whirl of life,
to stop and listen to them. I know what it is for a timid little
child, who has never been away from its mother&#8217;s apron string,
to be walked, some morning, into a great big school-room, full<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_399" id="Page_399">[Pg 399]</a></span>
of strange faces;&mdash;to see a little urchin laugh, and feel a choking
lump come in your little throat, for fear he was laughing at you;&mdash;to
stand up, with trembling legs, in the middle of the floor,
and be told to &ldquo;find big A,&rdquo; when your eyes were so full of
tears that you couldn&#8217;t see anything;&mdash;to keep looking at the
ferule on the desk, and wondering if it would ever come down
on your hand;&mdash;to have some mischievous little scholar break
your nice long slate-pencil in two, to plague you, or steal your
bit of gingerbread, out of your satchel, and eat it up, or trip
you down on purpose, and feel how little the hard-hearted young
sinners cared when you sobbed out, &ldquo;I&#8217;ll tell my mother.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="new_para">I know what it is, when you have lain every night since you
were born, with your hand clasped in your mother&#8217;s, and your
cheek cuddled up to hers, to see a new baby come and take
your place, without even asking your leave;&mdash;to see papa, and
grandpa, and grandma, and uncle, and aunt, and cousins, and
all the neighbors, so glad to see it, when <em>your</em> heart was almost
broke about it. I know what it is to have a great fat nurse
(whom even mamma herself had to mind) lead you, struggling,
out of the room, and tell Sally to see that you didn&#8217;t
come into your own mamma&#8217;s room again all that day. I
know what it is to have that fat old nurse sit in mamma&#8217;s place
at table, and cut up your potato and meat all wrong;&mdash;to
have her put squash on your plate, when you <em>hate</em> squash;&mdash;to
have her forget (?) to give you a piece of pie, and eat two
pieces <em>herself</em>;&mdash;to have Sally cross, and Betty cross, and
everybody telling you to &ldquo;get out of the way;&rdquo;&mdash;to have
your doll&#8217;s leg get loose, and nobody there to hitch it on for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_400" id="Page_400">[Pg 400]</a></span>
you;&mdash;and then, when it came night, to be put away in a
chamber, all alone by yourself to sleep, and have Sally tell
you that &ldquo;if you wasn&#8217;t good an old black man would come
and carry you off;&rdquo;&mdash;and then to cuddle down under the sheet,
till you were half stifled, and tremble every time the wind
blew, as if you had an ague fit. Yes, and when, at last, mamma
came down stairs, I know how <em>long</em> it took for you to like that
new baby;&mdash;how every time you wanted to sit in mamma&#8217;s lap,
he&#8217;d be sure to have the stomach-ache, or to want his breakfast;
how he was <em>always</em> wanting something, so that mamma
couldn&#8217;t tell you pretty stories, or build little blocks of houses
for you, or make you reins to play horse with; or do any of
those nice little things, that she used to be always doing for
you.</p>

<p class="new_para">To be sure, my little darlings, I know all about it. I have
cried tears enough to float a steamship, about all these provoking
things; and now whenever I see a little child cry, I never
feel like laughing at him: for I know that often his little heart
is just ready to break, for somebody to pet him. So I always
say a kind word, or give him a pat on the head, or a kiss; for
I know that though the little insect has but one grain to carry,
he often staggers under it: and I have seen the time when a
kind word, or a beaming smile, would have been worth more
to me, than all the broad lands of merrie England.</p>
